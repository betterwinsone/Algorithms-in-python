we are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates  for time for better editing 

please note   neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement 
the official release date of all project gutenberg etexts is at
midnight  central time  of the last day of the stated month   a
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion  comment
and editing by those who wish to do so   to be sure you have an
up to date first edition  xxxxx10x xxx  please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month   since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date  tried to fix and failed  a
look at the file size will have to do  but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less 


information about project gutenberg  one page 

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work   the
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected  entered  proofread  edited  copyright
searched and analyzed  the copyright letters written  etc   this
projected audience is one hundred million readers   if our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce  2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty two text
files per month   or 400 more etexts in 1996 for a total of 800 
if these reach just 10  of the computerized population  then the
total should reach 80 billion etexts 

the goal of project gutenberg is to give away one trillion etext
files by the december 31  2001    10 000 x 100 000 000 trillion 
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers 
which is only 10  of the present number of computer users   2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that  so it
will require us reaching less than 5  of the users in 2001

of truth




what is truth  said jesting pilate and would
not stay for an answer   certainly there be 
that delight in giddiness  and count it a bondage to
fix a belief  affecting free will in thinking  as well
as in acting   and though the sects of philosophers
of that kind be gone  yet there remain certain dis 
coursing wits  which are of the same veins  though
there be not so much blood in them  as was in those
of the ancients   but it is not only the difficulty and
labor  which men take in finding out of truth  nor
again  that when it is found  it imposeth upon
men s thoughts  that doth bring lies in favor  but
a natural  though corrupt love  of the lie itself   one
of the later school of the grecians  examineth the
matter  and is at a stand  to think what should be
in it  that men should love lies  where neither they
make for pleasure  as with poets  nor for advan 
tage  as with the merchant  but for the lie s sake 
but i cannot tell  this same truth  is a naked  and
open day light  that doth not show the masks  and
mummeries  and triumphs  of the world  half so
stately and daintily as candle lights   truth may
perhaps come to the price of a pearl  that showeth
best by day  but it will not rise to the price of a
diamond  or carbuncle  that showeth best in varied
lights   a mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure 
doth any man doubt  that if there were taken out
of men s minds  vain opinions  flattering hopes 
false valuations  imaginations as one would  and
the like  but it would leave the minds  of a number
of men  poor shrunken things  full of melancholy
and indisposition  and unpleasing to themselves 

one of the fathers  in great severity  called poesy
vinum daemonum  because it fireth the imagina 
tion  and yet  it is but with the shadow of a lie 
but it is not the lie that passeth through the mind 
but the lie that sinketh in  and settleth in it  that
doth the hurt  such as we spake of before   but how 
soever these things are thus in men s depraved
judgments  and affections  yet truth  which only
doth judge itself  teacheth that the inquiry of truth 
which is the love making  or wooing of it  the
knowledge of truth  which is the presence of it  and
the belief of truth  which is the enjoying of it  is
the sovereign good of human nature   the first
creature of god  in the works of the days  was the
light of the sense  the last  was the light of reason 
and his sabbath work ever since  is the illumina 
tion of his spirit   first he breathed light  upon the
face of the matter or chaos  then he breathed light 
into the face of man  and still he breatheth and in 
spireth light  into the face of his chosen   the poet 
that beautified the sect  that was otherwise in 
ferior to the rest  saith yet excellently well  it is a
pleasure  to stand upon the shore  and to see ships
tossed upon the sea  a pleasure  to stand in the win 
dow of a castle  and to see a battle  and the adven 
tures thereof below  but no pleasure is comparable
to the standing upon the vantage ground of truth
 a hill not to be commanded  and where the air is
always clear and serene   and to see the errors  and
wanderings  and mists  and tempests  in the vale
below  so always that this prospect be with pity 
and not with swelling  or pride   certainly  it is
heaven upon earth  to have a man s mind move in
charity  rest in providence  and turn upon the
poles of truth 

to pass from theological  and philosophical
truth  to the truth of civil business  it will be ac 
knowledged  even by those that practise it not  that
clear  and round dealing  is the honor of man s
nature  and that mixture of falsehoods  is like alloy
in coin of gold and silver  which may make the
metal work the better  but it embaseth it   for these
winding  and crooked courses  are the goings of the
serpent  which goeth basely upon the belly  and
not upon the feet   there is no vice  that doth so
cover a man with shame  as to be found false and
perfidious   and therefore montaigne saith pret 
tily  when he inquired the reason  why the word
of the lie should be such a disgrace  and such an
odious charge  saith he  if it be well weighed  to
say that a man lieth  is as much to say  as that he is
brave towards god  and a coward towards men 
for a lie faces god  and shrinks from man   surely
the wickedness of falsehood  and breach of faith 
cannot possibly be so highly expressed  as in that
it shall be the last peal  to call the judgments of god
upon the generations of men  it being foretold 
that when christ cometh  he shall not find faith
upon the earth 






of death



men fear death  as children fear to go in the
dark  and as that natural fear in children 
is increased with tales  so is the other   certainly 
the contemplation of death  as the wages of sin 
and passage to another world  is holy and relig 
ious  but the fear of it  as a tribute due unto nature 
is weak   yet in religious meditations  there is some 
times mixture of vanity  and of superstition   you
shall read  in some of the friars  books of mortifica 
tion  that a man should think with himself  what
the pain is  if he have but his finger s end pressed 
or tortured  and thereby imagine  what the pains
of death are  when the whole body is corrupted 
and dissolved  when many times death passeth 
with less pain than the torture of a limb  for the
most vital parts  are not the quickest of sense   and
by him that spake only as a philosopher  and nat 
ural man  it was well said  pompa mortis magis
terret  quam mors ipsa   groans  and convulsions 
and a discolored face  and friends weeping  and
blacks  and obsequies  and the like  show death
terrible   it is worthy the observing  that there is no
passion in the mind of man  so weak  but it mates 
and masters  the fear of death  and therefore 
death is no such terrible enemy  when a man hath
so many attendants about him  that can win the
combat of him   revenge triumphs over death  love
slights it  honor aspireth to it  grief flieth to it  fear
preoccupateth it  nay  we read  after otho the em 
peror had slain himself  pity  which is the tender 
est of affections  provoked many to die  out of mere
compassion to their sovereign  and as the truest
sort of followers   nay  seneca adds niceness and
satiety  cogita quamdiu eadem feceris  mori velle 
non tantum fortis aut miser  sed etiam fastidiosus
potest   a man would die  though he were neither
valiant  nor miserable  only upon a weariness to
do the same thing so oft  over and over   it is no less
worthy  to observe  how little alteration in good
spirits  the approaches of death make  for they
appear to be the same men  till the last instant 
augustus caesar died in a compliment  livia  con 
jugii nostri memor  vive et vale   tiberius in dissi 
mulation  as tacitus saith of him  jam tiberium
vires et corpus  non dissimulatio  deserebant   ves 
pasian in a jest  sitting upon the stool  ut puto deus
fio   galba with a sentence  feri  si ex re sit populi
romani  holding forth his neck   septimius severus
in despatch  adeste si quid mihi restat agendum 
and the like   certainly the stoics bestowed too
much cost upon death  and by their great prepara 
tions  made it appear more fearful   better saith he 
qui finem vitae extremum inter munera ponat
naturae   it is as natural to die  as to be born  and to
a little infant  perhaps  the one is as painful  as the
other   he that dies in an earnest pursuit  is like one
that is wounded in hot blood  who  for the time 
scarce feels the hurt  and therefore a mind fixed 
and bent upon somewhat that is good  doth avert
the dolors of death   but  above all  believe it  the
sweetest canticle is   nunc dimittis  when a man
hath obtained worthy ends  and expectations 
death hath this also  that it openeth the gate to
good fame  and extinguisheth envy    extinctus
amabitur idem 




of unity

in religion





religion being the chief band of human so 
ciety  it is a happy thing  when itself is well
contained within the true band of unity   the
quarrels  and divisions about religion  were evils
unknown to the heathen   the reason was  because
the religion of the heathen  consisted rather in
rites and ceremonies  than in any constant belief 
for you may imagine  what kind of faith theirs
was  when the chief doctors  and fathers of their
church  were the poets   but the true god hath this
attribute  that he is a jealous god  and therefore 
his worship and religion  will endure no mixture 
nor partner we shall therefore speak a few words 
concerning the unity of the church  what are the
fruits thereof   what the bounds  and what the
means 

the fruits of unity  next unto the well pleasing
of god  which is all in all  are two  the one  towards
those that are without the church  the other 
towards those that are within   for the former  it is
certain  that heresies  and schisms  are of all others
the greatest scandals  yea  more than corruption
of manners   for as in the natural body  a wound 
or solution of continuity  is worse than a corrupt
humor  so in the spiritual   so that nothing  doth so
much keep men out of the church  and drive men
out of the church  as breach of unity   and there 
fore  whensoever it cometh to that pass  that one
saith  ecce in deserto  another saith  ecce in pene 
tralibus  that is  when some men seek christ  in the
conventicles of heretics  and others  in an outward
face of a church  that voice had need continually
to sound in men s ears  nolite exire    go not out 
the doctor of the gentiles  the propriety of whose
vocation  drew him to have a special care of those
without  saith  if an heathen come in  and hear
you speak with several tongues  will he not say
that you are mad  and certainly it is little better 
when atheists  and profane persons  do hear of
so many discordant  and contrary opinions in re 
ligion  it doth avert them from the church  and
maketh them  to sit down in the chair of the
scorners  it is but a light thing  to be vouched in so
serious a matter  but yet it expresseth well the
deformity   there is a master of scoffing  that in his
catalogue of books of a feigned library  sets down
this title of a book  the morris dance of heretics 
for indeed  every sect of them  hath a diverse pos 
ture  or cringe by themselves  which cannot but
move derision in worldlings  and depraved politics 
who are apt to contemn holy things 

as for the fruit towards those that are within  it
is peace  which containeth infinite blessings   it
establisheth faith  it kindleth charity  the outward
peace of the church  distilleth into peace of con 
science  and it turneth the labors of writing  and
reading of controversies  into treaties of mortifica 
tion and devotion 

concerning the bounds of unity  the true plac 
ing of them  importeth exceedingly   there appear
to be two extremes   for to certain zealants  all
speech of pacification is odious   is it peace  jehu  
what hast thou to do with peace  turn thee be 
hind me   peace is not the matter  but following 
and party   contrariwise  certain laodiceans  and
lukewarm persons  think they may accommodate
points of religion  by middle way  and taking part
of both  and witty reconcilements  as if they would
make an arbitrament between god and man   both
these extremes are to be avoided  which will be
done  if the league of christians  penned by our
savior himself  were in two cross clauses thereof 
soundly and plainly expounded  he that is not
with us  is against us  and again  he that is not
against us  is with us  that is  if the points funda 
mental and of substance in religion  were truly
discerned and distinguished  from points not
merely of faith  but of opinion  order  or good in 
tention   this is a thing may seem to many a matter
trivial  and done already   but if it were done less
partially  it would be embraced more generally 

of this i may give only this advice  according to
my small model   men ought to take heed  of rend 
ing god s church  by two kinds of controversies 
the one is  when the matter of the point contro 
verted  is too small and light  not worth the heat
and strife about it  kindled only by contradiction 
for  as it is noted  by one of the fathers  christ s
coat indeed had no seam  but the church s vesture
was of divers colors  whereupon he saith  in veste
varietas sit  scissura non sit  they be two things 
unity and uniformity   the other is  when the
matter of the point controverted  is great  but it is
driven to an over great subtilty  and obscurity  so
that it becometh a thing rather ingenious  than
substantial   a man that is of judgment and under 
standing  shall sometimes hear ignorant men dif 
fer  and know well within himself  that those
which so differ  mean one thing  and yet they
themselves would never agree   and if it come so
to pass  in that distance of judgment  which is be 
tween man and man  shall we not think that god
above  that knows the heart  doth not discern that
frail men  in some of their contradictions  intend
the same thing  and accepteth of both  the nature
of such controversies is excellently expressed  by
st  paul  in the warning and precept  that he giveth
concerning the same  devita profanas vocum novi 
tates  et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae   men
create oppositions  which are not  and put them
into new terms  so fixed  as whereas the meaning
ought to govern the term  the term in effect gov 
erneth the meaning there be also two false peaces 
or unities  the one  when the peace is grounded 
but upon an implicit ignorance  for all colors will
agree in the dark  the other  when it is pieced up 
upon a direct admission of contraries  in funda 
mental points   for truth and falsehood  in such
things  are like the iron and clay  in the toes of
nebuchadnezzar s image  they may cleave  but
they will not incorporate 

concerning the means of procuring unity  men
must beware  that in the procuring  or reuniting 
of religious unity  they do not dissolve and deface
the laws of charity  and of human society   there
be two swords amongst christians  the spiritual
and temporal  and both have their due office and
place  in the maintenance of religion   but we may
not take up the third sword  which is mahomet s
sword  or like unto it  that is  to propagate religion
by wars  or by sanguinary persecutions to force
consciences  except it be in cases of overt scandal 
blasphemy  or intermixture of practice against
the state  much less to nourish seditions  to author 
ize conspiracies and rebellions  to put the sword
into the people s hands  and the like  tending to
the subversion of all government  which is the
ordinance of god   for this is but to dash the first
table against the second  and so to consider men
as christians  as we forget that they are men 
lucretius the poet  when he beheld the act of aga 
memnon  that could endure the sacrificing of his
own daughter  exclaimed  tantum religio potuit
suadere malorum 

what would he have said  if he had known of
the massacre in france  or the powder treason of
england  he would have been seven times more
epicure  and atheist  than he was   for as the tem 
poral sword is to be drawn with great circumspec 
tion in cases of religion  so it is a thing monstrous
to put it into the hands of the common people   let
that be left unto the anabaptists  and other furies 
it was great blasphemy  when the devil said  i will
ascend  and be like the highest  but it is greater
blasphemy  to personate god  and bring him in
saying  i will descend  and be like the prince of
darkness  and what is it better  to make the cause
of religion to descend  to the cruel and execrable
actions of murthering princes  butchery of people 
and subversion of states and governments  surely
this is to bring down the holy ghost  instead of the
likeness of a dove  in the shape of a vulture or
raven  and set  out of the bark of a christian
church  a flag of a bark of pirates  and assassins 
therefore it is most necessary  that the church  by
doctrine and decree  princes by their sword  and
all learnings  both christian and moral  as by their
mercury rod  do damn and send to hell for ever 
those facts and opinions tending to the support of
the same  as hath been already in good part done 
surely in counsels concerning religion  that coun 
sel of the apostle would be prefixed  ira hominis
non implet justitiam dei   and it was a notable
observation of a wise father  and no less ingenu 
ously confessed  that those which held and per 
suaded pressure of consciences  were commonly
interested therein   themselves  for their own ends 




of revenge


revenge is a kind of wild justice  which the
more man  s nature runs to  the more ought
law to weed it out   for as for the first wrong  it
doth but offend the law  but the revenge of that
wrong  putteth the law out of office   certainly  in
taking revenge  a man is but even with his enemy 
but in passing it over  he is superior  for it is a
prince s part to pardon   and solomon  i am sure 
saith  it is the glory of a man  to pass by an offence 
that which is past is gone  and irrevocable  and
wise men have enough to do  with things present
and to come  therefore they do but trifle with
themselves  that labor in past matters   there is no
man doth a wrong  for the wrong s sake  but
thereby to purchase himself profit  or pleasure  or
honor  or the like   therefore why should i be
angry with a man  for loving himself better than
me  and if any man should do wrong  merely out
of ill nature  why  yet it is but like the thorn or
briar  which prick and scratch  because they can
do no other   the most tolerable sort of revenge  is
for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy 
but then let a man take heed  the revenge be such
as there is no law to punish  else a man s enemy is
still before hand  and it is two for one   some  when
they take revenge  are desirous  the party should
know  whence it cometh   this is the more gener 
ous   for the delight seemeth to be  not so much in
doing the hurt  as in making the party repent   but
base and crafty cowards  are like the arrow that
flieth in the dark   cosmus  duke of florence  had a
desperate saying against perfidious or neglecting
friends  as if those wrongs were unpardonable 
you shall read  saith he  that we are commanded
to forgive our enemies  but you never read  that we
are commanded to forgive our friends   but yet the
spirit of job was in a better tune  shall we  saith
he  take good at god s hands  and not be content to
take evil also  and so of friends in a proportion 
this is certain  that a man that studieth revenge 
keeps his own wounds green  which otherwise
would heal  and do well   public revenges are for
the most part fortunate  as that for the death of
caesar  for the death of pertinax  for the death of
henry the third of france  and many more   but
in private revenges  it is not so   nay rather  vindic 
tive persons live the life of witches  who  as they
are mischievous  so end they infortunate 




of adversity


it was an high speech of seneca  after the
manner of the stoics   that the good things 
which belong to prosperity  are to be wished  but
the good things  that belong to adversity  are to be
admired   bona rerum secundarum optabilia  ad 
versarum mirabilia   certainly if miracles be the
command over nature  they appear most in adver 
sity   it is yet a higher speech of his  than the other
 much too high for a heathen   it is true greatness 
to have in one the frailty of a man  and the security
of a god   vere magnum habere fragilitatem homi 
nis  securitatem dei   this would have done better
in poesy  where transcendences are more allowed 
and the poets indeed have been busy with it  for
it is in effect the thing  which figured in that
strange fiction of the ancient poets  which seemeth
not to be without mystery  nay  and to have some
approach to the state of a christian  that hercules 
when he went to unbind prometheus  by whom
human nature is represented   sailed the length of
the great ocean  in an earthen pot or pitcher  lively
describing christian resolution  that saileth in the
frail bark of the flesh  through the waves of the
world   but to speak in a mean   the virtue of pros 
perity  is temperance  the virtue of adversity  is
fortitude  which in morals is the more heroical
virtue   prosperity is the blessing of the old testa 
ment  adversity is the blessing of the new  which
carrieth the greater benediction  and the clearer
revelation of god s favor   yet even in the old
testament  if you listen to david s harp  you shall
hear as many hearse like airs as carols  and the
pencil of the holy ghost hath labored more in de 
scribing the afflictions of job  than the felicities of
solomon   prosperity is not without many fears
and distastes  and adversity is not without com 
forts and hopes   we see in needle works and em 
broideries  it is more pleasing to have a lively work 
upon a sad and solemn ground  than to have a dark
and melancholy work  upon a lightsome ground 
judge therefore of the pleasure of the heart  by the
pleasure of the eye   certainly virtue is like precious
odors  most fragrant when they are incensed  or
crushed  for prosperity doth best discover vice  but
adversity doth best discover virtue 




of simulation
and dissimulation



dissimulation is but a faint kind of pol 
icy  or wisdom  for it asketh a strong wit 
and a strong heart  to know when to tell truth  and
to do it   therefore it is the weaker sort of politics 
that are the great dissemblers 

tacitus saith  livia sorted well with the arts of
her husband  and dissimulation of her son  attri 
buting arts or policy to augustus  and dissimula 
tion to tiberius   and again  when mucianus
encourageth vespasian  to take arms against vitel 
lius  he saith  we rise not against the piercing
judgment of augustus  nor the extreme caution or
closeness of tiberius   these properties  of arts or
policy  and dissimulation or closeness  are indeed
habits and faculties several  and to be distin 
guished   for if a man have that penetration of
judgment  as he can discern what things are to
be laid open  and what to be secreted  and what to
be showed at half lights  and to whom and when
 which indeed are arts of state  and arts of life  as
tacitus well calleth them   to him  a habit of dis 
simulation is a hinderance and a poorness   but if
a man cannot obtain to that judgment  then it is
left to bim generally  to be close  and a dissembler 
for where a man cannot choose  or vary in parti 
culars  there it is good to take the safest  and wari 
est way  in general  like the going softly  by one
that cannot well see   certainly the ablest men
that ever were  have had all an openness  and
frankness  of dealing  and a name of certainty and
veracity  but then they were like horses well
managed  for they could tell passing well  when to
stop or turn  and at such times  when they thought
the case indeed required dissimulation  if then
they used it  it came to pass that the former opin 
ion  spread abroad  of their good faith and clear 
ness of dealing  made them almost invisible 

there be three degrees of this hiding and veil 
ing of a man s self   the first  closeness  reservation 
and secrecy  when a man leaveth himself without
observation  or without hold to be taken  what he
is  the second  dissimulation  in the negative 
when a man lets fall signs and arguments  that he
is not  that he is   and the third  simulation  in the
affirmative  when a man industriously and ex 
pressly feigns and pretends to be  that he is not 

for the first of these  secrecy  it is indeed the
virtue of a confessor   and assuredly  the secret
man heareth many confessions   for who will open
himself  to a blab or a babbler  but if a man be
thought secret  it inviteth discovery  as the more
close air sucketh in the more open  and as in con 
fession  the revealing is not for worldly use  but for
the ease of a man s heart  so secret men come to
the knowledge of many things in that kind  while
men rather discharge their minds  than impart
their minds   in few words  mysteries are due to
secrecy   besides  to say truth  nakedness is un 
comely  as well in mind as body  and it addeth no
small reverence  to men s manners and actions  if
they be not altogether open   as for talkers and
futile persons  they are commonly vain and credu 
lous withal   for he that talketh what he knoweth 
will also talk what he knoweth not   therefore set it
down  that an habit of secrecy  is both politic and
moral   and in this part  it is good that a man s face
give his tongue leave to speak   for the discovery of
a man  s self  by the tracts of his countenance  is a
great weakness and betraying  by how much it is
many times more marked  and believed  than a
man s words 

for the second  which is dissimulation  it fol 
loweth many times upon secrecy  by a necessity 
so that he that will be secret  must be a dissembler
in some degree   for men are too cunning  to suffer
a man to keep an indifferent carriage between
both  and to be secret  without swaying the bal 
ance on either side   they will so beset a man with
questions  and draw him on  and pick it out of him 
that  without an absurd silence  he must show an
inclination one way  or if he do not  they will
gather as much by his silence  as by his speech   as
for equivocations  or oraculous speeches  they can 
not hold out long   so that no man can be secret 
except he give himself a little scope of dissimula 
tion  which is  as it were  but the skirts or train of
secrecy 

but for the third degree  which is simulation 
and false profession  that i hold more culpable 
and less politic  except it be in great and rare mat 
ters   and therefore a general custom of simulation
 which is this last degree  is a vice  using either of
a natural falseness or fearfulness  or of a mind that
hath some main faults  which because a man must
needs disguise  it maketh him practise simulation
in other things  lest his hand should be out of use 

the great advantages of simulation and dissi 
mulation are three   first  to lay asleep opposition 
and to surprise   for where a man s intentions are
published  it is an alarum  to call up all that are
against them   the second is  to reserve to a man s
self a fair retreat   for if a man engage himself by
a manifest declaration  he must go through or take
a fall   the third is  the better to discover the mind
of another   for to him that opens himself  men
will hardly show themselves adverse  but will fair
let him go on  and turn their freedom of speech  to
freedom of thought   and therefore it is a good
shrewd proverb of the spaniard  tell a lie and find
a troth   as if there were no way of discovery  but
by simulation   there be also three disadvantages 
to set it even   the first  that simulation and dissi 
mulation commonly carry with them a show of
fearfulness  which in any business  doth spoil the
feathers  of round flying up to the mark   the sec 
ond  that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits
of many  that perhaps would otherwise co operate
with him  and makes a man walk almost alone  to
his own ends   the third and greatest is  that it
depriveth a man of one of the most principal in 
struments for action  which is trust and belief 
the best composition and temperature  is to have
openness in fame and opinion  secrecy in habit 
dissimulation in seasonable use  and a power to
feign  if there be no remedy 





of parents

and children






the joys of parents are secret  and so are their
griefs and fears   they cannot utter the one 
nor they will not utter the other   children sweeten
labors  but they make misfortunes more bitter 
they increase the cares of life  but they mitigate
the remembrance of death   the perpetuity by
generation is common to beasts  but memory 
merit  and noble works  are proper to men   and
surely a man shall see the noblest works and foun 
dations have proceeded from childless men  which
have sought to express the images of their minds 
where those of their bodies have failed   so the care
of posterity is most in them  that have no posterity 
they that are the first raisers of their houses  are
most indulgent towards their children  beholding
them as the continuance  not only of their kind  but
of their work  and so both children and creatures 

the difference in affection  of parents towards
their several children  is many times unequal  and
sometimes unworthy  especially in the mothers 
as solomon saith  a wise son rejoiceth the father 
but an ungracious son shames the mother   a man
shall see  where there is a house full of children 
one or two of the eldest respected  and the young 
est made wantons  but in the midst  some that
are as it were forgotten  who many times  never 
theless  prove the best   the illiberality of parents 
in allowance towards their children  is an harmful
error  makes them base  acquaints them with
shifts  makes them sort with mean company  and
makes them surfeit more when they come to
plenty   and therefore the proof is best  when men
keep their authority towards the children  but not
their purse   men have a foolish manner  both par 
ents and schoolmasters and servants  in creating
and breeding an emulation between brothers  dur 
ing childhood  which many times sorteth to dis 
cord when they are men  and disturbeth families 
the italians make little difference between chil 
dren  and nephews or near kinsfolks  but so they
be of the lump  they care not though they pass not
through their own body   and  to say truth  in
nature it is much a like matter  insomuch that we
see a nephew sometimes resembleth an uncle  or
a kinsman  more than his own parent  as the blood
happens   let parents choose betimes  the vocations
and courses they mean their children should take 
for then they are most flexible  and let them not
too much apply themselves to the disposition of
their children  as thinking they will take best to
that  which they have most mind to   it is true  that
if the affection or aptness of the children be extra 
ordinary  then it is good not to cross it  but gener 
ally the precept is good  optimum elige  suave et
facile illud faciet consuetudo   younger brothers
are commonly fortunate  but seldom or never
where the elder are disinherited 





of marriage

and single life





he that hath wife and children hath given
hostages to fortune  for they are impedi 
ments to great enterprises  either of virtue or mis 
chief   certainly  the  best  works   and  of  greatest
merit for the  public   have  proceeded  from  the  un 
married or childless men  which both in affection
and means  have married and endowed the public 
yet it were great reason that those that have chil 
dren  should have greatest care of future times 
unto which they know they must transmit their
dearest pledges   some there are  who though they
lead a single life  yet their thoughts do end with
themselves  and account future times imperti 
nences   nay  there are some other  that account
wife and children  but as bills of charges   nay
more  there are some foolish rich covetous men 
that take a pride  in having no children  because
they may be thought so much the richer   for per 
haps they have heard some talk  such an one is a
great rich man  and another except to it  yea  but
he hath a great charge of children  as if it were an
abatement to his riches   but the most ordinary
cause of a single life  is liberty  especially in certain
self pleasing and humorous minds  which are so
sensible of every restraint  as they will go near to
think their girdles and garters  to be bonds and
shackles   unmarried men are best friends  best
masters  best servants  but not always best sub 
jects  for they are light to run away  and almost
all fugitives  are of that condition   a single life
doth well with churchmen  for charity will hardly
water the ground  where it must first fill a pool   it
is indifferent for judges and magistrates  for if
they be facile and corrupt  you shall have a ser 
vant  five times worse than a wife   for soldiers  i
find the generals commonly in their hortatives 
put men in mind of their wives and children  and
i think the despising of marriage amongst the
turks  maketh the vulgar soldier more base   cer 
tainly wife and children are a kind of discipline
of humanity  and single men  though they may
be many times more charitable  because their
means are less exhaust  yet  on the other side  they
are more cruel and hardhearted  good to make
severe inquisitors   because their tenderness is not
so oft called upon   grave natures  led by custom 
and therefore constant  are commonly loving hus 
bands  as was said of ulysses  vetulam suam praetu 
lit immortalitati   chaste women are often proud
and froward  as presuming upon the merit of their
chastity   it is one of the best bonds  both of chastity
and obedience  in the wife  if she think her hus 
band wise  which she will never do  if she find him
jealous   wives are young men s mistresses  com 
panions for middle age  and old men s nurses   so
as a man may have a quarrel to marry  when he
will   but yet he was reputed one of the wise men 
that made answer to the question  when a man
should marry    a young man not yet  an elder
man not at all   it is often seen that bad husbands 
have very good wives  whether it be  that it raiseth
the price of their husband s kindness  when it
comes  or that the wives take a pride in their
patience   but this never fails  if the bad husbands
were of their own choosing  against their friends 
consent  for then they will be sure to make good
their own folly 





of envy



there be none of the affections  which have
been noted to fascinate or bewitch  but love
and envy   they both have vehement wishes  they
frame themselves readily into imaginations and
suggestions  and they come easily into the eye 
especially upon the present of the objects  which
are the points that conduce to fascination  if any
such thing there be   we see likewise  the scripture
calleth envy an evil eye  and the astrologers  call
the evil influences of the stars  evil aspects  so that
still there seemeth to be acknowledged  in the act
of envy  an ejaculation or irradiation of the eye 
nay  some have been so curious  as to note  that
the times when the stroke or percussion of an envi 
ous eye doth most hurt  are when the party envied
is beheld in glory or triumph  for that sets an edge
upon envy  and besides  at such times the spirits
of the person envied  do come forth most into the
outward parts  and so meet the blow 

but leaving these curiosities  though not un 
worthy to be thought on  in fit place   we will
handle  what persons are apt to envy others  what
persons are most subject to be envied themselves 
and what is the difference between public and
private envy 

a man that hath no virtue in himself  ever en 
vieth virtue in others   for men s minds  will either
feed upon their own good  or upon others  evil  and
who wanteth the one  will prey upon the other 
and whoso is out of hope  to attain to another s
virtue  will seek to come at even hand  by depress 
ing another s fortune 

a man that is busy  and inquisitive  is com 
monly envious   for to know much of other men s
matters  cannot be because all that ado may con 
cern his own estate  therefore it must needs be 
that he taketh a kind of play pleasure  in looking
upon the fortunes of others   neither can he  that
mindeth but his own business  find much matter
for envy   for envy is a gadding passion  and walk 
eth the streets  and doth not keep home  non est
curiosus  quin idem sit malevolus 

men of noble birth  are noted to be envious
towards new men  when they rise   for the distance
is altered  and it is like a deceit of the eye  that
when others come on  they think themselves  go
back 

deformed persons  and eunuchs  and old men 
and bastards  are envious   for he that cannot pos 
sibly mend his own case  will do what he can  to
impair another s  except these defects light upon
a very brave  and heroical nature  which thinketh
to make his natural wants part of his honor  in that
it should be said  that an eunuch  or a lame man 
did such great matters  affecting the honor of a
miracle  as it was in narses the eunuch  and agesi 
laus and tamberlanes  that were lame men 

the same is the case of men  that rise after ca 
lamities and misfortunes   for they are as men
fallen out with the times  and think other men s
harms  a redemption of their own sufferings 

they that desire to excel in too many matters 
out of levity and vain glory  are ever envious   for
they cannot want work  it being impossible  but
many  in some one of those things  should surpass
them   which was the character of adrian the em 
peror  that mortally envied poets  and painters 
and artificers  in works wherein he had a vein to
excel 

lastly  near kinsfolks  and fellows in office  and
those that have been bred together  are more apt
to envy their equals  when they are raised   for it
doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes  and
pointeth at them  and cometh oftener into their
remembrance  and incurreth likewise more into
the note of others  and envy ever redoubleth from
speech and fame   cain s envy was the more vile
and malignant  towards his brother abel  because
when his sacrifice was better accepted  there was
no body to look on   thus much for those  that are
apt to envy 

concerning those that are more or less subject
to envy  first  persons of eminent virtue  when
they are advanced  are less envied   for their for 
tune seemeth   but due unto them  and no man
envieth the payment of a debt  but rewards and
liberality rather   again  envy is ever joined with
the comparing of a man s self  and where there is
no comparison  no envy  and therefore kings are
not envied  but by kings   nevertheless it is to be
noted  that unworthy persons are most envied  at
their first coming in  and afterwards overcome it
better  whereas contrariwise  persons of worth
and merit are most envied  when their fortune
continueth long   for by that time  though their
virtue be the same  yet it hath not the same lustre 
for fresh men grow up that darken it 

persons of noble blood  are less envied in their
rising   for it seemeth but right done to their birth 
besides  there seemeth not much added to their
fortune  and envy is as the sunbeams  that beat
hotter upon a bank  or steep rising ground  than
upon a flat   and for the same reason  those that are
advanced by degrees  are less envied than those
that are advanced suddenly and per saltum 

those that have joined with their honor great
travels  cares  or perils  are less subject to envy 
for men think that they earn their honors hardly 
and pity them sometimes  and pity ever healeth
envy   wherefore you shall observe  that the more
deep and sober sort of politic persons  in their
greataess  are ever bemoaning themselves  what
a life they lead  chanting a quanta patimur  not
that they feel it so  but only to abate the edge of
envy   but this is to be understood  of business that
is laid upon men  and not such  as they call unto
themselves   for nothing increaseth envy more 
than an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of
business   and nothing doth extinguish envy more 
than for a great person to preserve all other infe 
rior officers  in their full lights and pre eminences
of their places   for by that means  there be so
many screens between him and envy 

above all  those are most subject to envy  which
carry the greatness of their fortunes  in an insolent
and proud manner  being never well  but while
they are showing how great they are  either by
outward pomp  or by triumphing over all opposi 
tion or competition  whereas wise men will rather
do sacrifice to envy  in suffering themselves some 
times of purpose to be crossed  and overborne in
things that do not much concern them   notwith 
standing  so much is true  that the carriage of
greatness  in a plain and open manner  so it be
without arrogancy and vain glory  doth draw less
envy  than if it be in a more crafty and cunning
fashion   for in that course  a man doth but dis 
avow fortune  and seemeth to be conscious of his
own want in worth  and doth but teach others  to
envy him 

lastly  to conclude this part  as we said in the
beginning  that the act of envy had somewhat in
it of witchcraft  so there is no other cure of envy 
but the cure of witchcraft  and that is  to remove
the lot  as they call it  and to lay it upon another 
for which purpose  the wiser sort of great persons 
bring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom
to derive the envy  that would come upon them 
selves  sometimes upon ministers and servants 
sometimes upon colleagues and associates  and the
like  and for that turn there are never wanting 
some persons of violent and undertaking natures 
who  so they may have power and business  will
take it at any cost 

now  to speak of public envy   there is yet some
good in public envy  whereas in private  there is
none   for public envy  is as an ostracism  that
eclipseth men  when they grow too great   and
therefore it is a bridle also to great ones  to keep
them within bounds 

this envy  being in the latin word invidia 
goeth in the modern language  by the name of
discontentment  of which we shall speak  in hand 
ling sedition   it is a disease  in a state  like to infec 
tion   for as infection spreadeth upon that which is
sound  and tainteth it  so when envy is gotten once
into a state  it traduceth even the best actions
thereof  and turneth them into an ill odor   and
therefore there is little won  by intermingling of
plausible actions   for that doth argue but a weak 
ness  and fear of envy  which hurteth so much the
more  as it is likewise usual in infections  which
if you fear them  you call them upon you 

this public envy  seemeth to beat chiefly upon
principal officers or ministers  rather than upon
kings  and estates themselves   but this is a sure
rule  that if the envy upon the minister be great 
when the cause of it in him is small  or if the envy
be general  in a manner upon all the ministers of
an estate  then the envy  though hidden  is truly
upon the state itself   and so much of public envy
or discontentment  and the difference thereof from
private envy  which was handled in the first place 

we will add this in general  touching the affec 
tion of envy  that of all other affections  it is the
most importune and continual   for of other affec 
tions  there is occasion given  but now and then 
and therefore it was well said  invidia festos dies
non agit  for it is ever working upon some or other 
and it is also noted  that love and envy do make a
man pine  which other affections do not  because
they are not so continual   it is also the vilest affec 
tion  and the most depraved  for which cause it
is the proper attribute of the devil  who is called 
the envious man  that soweth tares amongst the
wheat by night  as it always cometh to pass  that
envy worketh subtilly  and in the dark  and to the
prejudice of good things  such as is the wheat 







of love




the stage is more beholding to love  than the
life of man   for as to the stage  love is ever
matter of comedies  and now and then of tragedies 
but in life it doth much mischief  sometimes like a
siren  sometimes like a fury   you may observe  that
amongst all the great and worthy persons  whereof
the memory remaineth  either ancient or recent 
there is not one  that hath been transported to
the mad degree of love  which shows that great
spirits  and great business  do keep out this weak
passion   you must except  nevertheless  marcus
antonius  the half partner of the empire of rome 
and appius claudius  the decemvir and lawgiver 
whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man 
and inordinate  but the latter was an austere and
wise man  and therefore it seems  though rarely 
that love can find entrance  not only into an open
heart  but also into a heart well fortified  if watch
be not well kept   it is a poor saying of epicurus 
satis  magnum  alter  alteri  theatrum  sumus   as   if
man   made  for  the  contemplation  of   heaven    and
all noble objects  should do nothing but kneel be 
fore a little idol  and make himself a subject 
though not of the mouth  as beasts are   yet of the
eye  which was given him for higher purposes   it
is a strange thing  to note the excess of this passion 
and how it braves the nature  and value of things 
by this  that the speaking in a perpetual hyper 
bole  is comely in nothing but in love   neither is it
merely in the phrase  for whereas it hath been
well said  that the arch flatterer  with whom all
the petty flatterers have intelligence  is a man s
self  certainly the lover is more   for there was
never proud man thought so absurdly well of him 
self  as the lover doth of the person loved  and
therefore it was well said  that it is impossible to
love  and to be wise   neither doth this weakness
appear to others only  and not to the party loved 
but to the loved most of all  except the love be reci 
proque   for it is a true rule  that love is ever re 
warded  either with the reciproque  or with an
inward and secret contempt   by how much the
more  men ought to beware of this passion  which
loseth not only other things  but itself  as for the
other losses  the poet s relation doth well figure
them  that he that preferred helena  quitted the
gifts of juno and pallas   for whosoever esteemeth
too much of amorous affection  quitteth both riches
and wisdom   this passion hath his floods  in very
times of weakness  which are great prosperity  and
great adversity  though this latter hath been less
observed  both which times kindle love  and make
it more fervent  and therefore show it to be the
child of folly   they do best  who if they cannot but
admit love  yet make it keep quarters  and sever it
wholly from their serious affairs  and actions  of
life  for if it check once with business  it troubleth
men s fortunes  and maketh men  that they can no
ways be true to their own ends   i know not how 
but martial men are given to love  i think  it is but
as they are given to wine  for perils commonly ask
to be paid in pleasures   there is in man s nature  a
secret inclination and motion  towards love of
others  which if it be not spent upon some one or a
few  doth naturally spread itself towards many 
and maketh men become humane and charitable 
as it is seen sometime in friars   nuptial love maketh
mankind  friendly love perfecteth it  but wanton
love corrupteth  and embaseth it 




of great place


men in great place are thrice servants  ser 
vants of the sovereign or state  servants of
fame  and servants of business   so as they have no
freedom  neither in their persons  nor in their ac 
tions  nor in their times   it is a strange desire  to
seek power and to lose liberty  or to seek power
over others  and to lose power over a man s self 
the rising unto place is laborious  and by pains 
men come to greater pains  and it is sometimes
base  and by indignities  men come to dignities 
the standing is slippery  and the regress is either
a downfall  or at least an eclipse  which is a melan 
choly thing   cum non sis qui fueris  non esse cur
velis vivere   nay  retire men cannot when they
would  neither will they  when it were reason  but
are impatient of privateness  even in age and sick 
ness  which require the shadow  like old towns 
men  that will be still sitting at their street door 
though thereby they offer age to scom   certainly
great persons had need to borrow other men s
opinions  to think themselves happy  for if they
judge by their own feeling  they cannot find it  but
if they think with themselves  what other men
think of them  and that other men would fain be 
as they are  then they are happy  as it were  by
report  when perhaps they find the contrary
within   for they are the first  that find their own
griefs  though they be the last  that find their
own faults   certainly men in great fortunes are
strangers to themselves  and while they are in the
puzzle of business  they have no time to tend their
health  either of body or mind   illi mors gravis
incubat  qui notus nimis omnibus  ignotus moritur
sibi   in place  there is license to do good  and evil 
whereof the latter is a curse  for in evil  the best
condition is not to win  the second  not to can   but
power to do good  is the true and lawful end of
aspiring   for good thoughts  though god accept
them  yet  towards men  are little better than good
dreams  except they be put in act  and that cannot
be  without power and place  as the vantage  and
commanding ground   merit and good works  is
the end of man s motion  and conscience of the
same is the accomplishment of man s rest   for if a
man can be partaker of god s theatre  he shall like 
wise be partaker of god s rest   et conversus deus 
ut aspiceret opera quae fecerunt manus suae  vidit
quod omnia essent bona nimis  and then the sab 
bath   in the discharge of thy place  set before thee
the best examples  for imitation is a globe of pre 
cepts   and after a time  set before thee thine own
example  and examine thyself strictly  whether
thou didst not best at first   neglect not also the
examples  of those that have carried themselves
ill  in the same place  not to set off thyself  by tax 
ing their memory  but to direct thyself  what to
avoid   reform therefore  without bravery  or scan 
dal of former times and persons  but yet set it down
to thyself  as well to create good precedents  as to
follow them   reduce things to the first institution 
and observe wherein  and how  they have degen 
erate  but yet ask counsel of both times  of the
ancient time  what is best  and of the latter time 
what is fittest   seek to make thy course regular 
that men may know beforehand  what they may
expect  but be not too positive and peremptory 
and express thyself well  when thou digressest
from thy rule   preserve the right of thy place  but
stir not questions of jurisdiction  and rather as 
sume thy right  in silence and de facto  than voice
it with claims  and challenges   preserve likewise
the rights of inferior places  and think it more
honor  to direct in chief  than to be busy in all 
embrace and invite helps  and advices  touching
the execution of thy place  and do not drive away
such  as bring thee information  as meddlers  but
accept of them in good part   the vices of authority
are chiefly four  delays  corruption  roughness 
and facility   for delays  give easy access  keep
times appointed  go through with that which is in
hand  and interlace not business  but of necessity 
for corruption  do not only bind thine own hands 
or thy servants  hands  from taking  but bind the
hands of suitors also  from offering   for integrity
used doth the one  but integrity professed  and
with a manifest detestation of bribery  doth the
other   and avoid not only the fault  but the sus 
picion   whosoever is found variable  and changeth
manifestly without manifest cause  giveth sus 
picion of corruption   therefore always  when thou
changest thine opinion or course  profess it plainly 
and declare it  together with the reasons that move
thee to change  and do not think to steal it   a
servant or a favorite  if he be inward  and no
other apparent cause of esteem  is commonly
thought  but a by way to close corruption   for
roughness  it is a needless cause of discontent 
severity breedeth fear  but roughness breedeth
hate   even reproofs from authority  ought to be
grave  and not taunting   as for facility  it is worse
than bribery   for bribes come but now and then 
but if importunity  or idle respects  lead a man  he
shall never be without   as solomon saith  to re 
spect persons is not good  for such a man will
transgress for a piece of bread   it is most true  that
was anciently spoken  a place showeth the man 
and it showeth some to the better  and some to the
worse   omnium consensu capax imperii  nisi im 
perasset  saith tacitus of galba  but of vespasian
he saith  solus imperantium  vespasianus mutatus
in melius  though the one was meant of sufficiency 
the other of manners  and affection   it is an assured
sign of a worthy and generous spirit  whom honor
amends   for honor is  or should be  the place of
virtue  and as in nature  things move violently to
their place  and calmly in their place  so virtue in
ambition is violent  in authority settled and calm 
all rising to great place is by a winding star  and
if there be factions  it is good to side a man s self 
whilst he is in the rising  and to balance himself
when he is placed   use the memory of thy prede 
cessor  fairly and tenderly  for if thou dost not  it is
a debt will sure be paid when thou art gone   if
thou have colleagues  respect them  and rather call
them  when they look not for it  than exclude
them   when they have reason to look to be called 
be not too sensible  or too remembering  of thy
place in conversation  and private answers to
suitors  but let it rather be said  when he sits in
place  he is another man 






of boldness


it is a trivial grammar school text  but yet
worthy a wise man s consideration   question
was asked of demosthenes  what was the chief
part of an orator  he answered  action  what next 
action  what next again  action   he said it  that
knew it best  and had  by nature  himself no ad 
vantage in that he commended   a strange thing 
that that part of an orator  which is but superficial 
and rather the virtue of a player  should be placed
so high  above those other noble parts  of invention 
elocution  and the rest  nay  almost alone  as if it
were all in all   but the reason is plain   there is in
human nature generally  more of the fool than of
the wise  and therefore those faculties  by which
the foolish part of men s minds is taken  are most
potent   wonderful like is the case of boldness in
civil business  what first  boldness  what second
and third  boldness   and yet boldness is a child of
ignorance and baseness  far inferior to other parts 
but nevertheless it doth fascinate  and bind hand
and foot  those that are either shallow in judg 
ment  or weak in courage  which are the greatest
part  yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak
times   therefore we see it hath done wonders  in
popular states  but with senates  and princes less 
and more ever upon the first entrance of bold per 
sons into action  than soon after  for boldness is an
ill keeper of promise   surely  as there are mounte 
banks for the natural body  so are there mounte 
banks for the politic body  men that undertake
great cures  and perhaps have been lucky  in two
or three experiments  but want the grounds of
science  and therefore cannot hold out   nay  you
shall see a bold fellow many times do mahomet s
miracle   mahomet made the people believe that
he would call an hill to him  and from the top of it
offer up his prayers  for the observers of his law 
the people assembled  mahomet called the hill to
come to him  again and again  and when the hill
stood still  he was never a whit abashed  but said 
if the hill will not come to mahomet  mahomet
will go to the hill   so these men  when they have
promised great matters  and failed most shame 
fully  yet  if they have the perfection of boldness 
they will but slight it over  and make a turn  and
no more ado   certainly to men of great judgment 
bold persons are a sport to behold  nay  and to the
vulgar also  boldness has somewhat of the ridicu 
lous   for if absurdity be the subject of laughter 
doubt you not but great boldness is seldom without
some absurdity   especially it is a sport to see  when
a bold fellow is out of countenance  for that puts
his face into a most shrunken  and wooden pos 
ture  as needs it must  for in bashfulness  the spirits
do a little go and come  but with bold men  upon
like occasion  they stand at a stay  like a stale at
chess  where it is no mate  but yet the game cannot
stir   but this last were fitter for a satire than for a
serious observation   this is well to be weighed 
that boldness is ever blind  for it seeth not danger 
and inconveniences   therefore it is ill in counsel 
good in execution  so that the right use of bold per 
sons is  that they never command in chief  but be
seconds  and under the direction of others   for in
counsel  it is good to see dangers  and in execution 
not to see them  except they be very great 




of goodness
  goodness of nature







i take goodness in this sense  the affecting of
the weal of men  which is that the grecians
call philanthropia  and the word humanity  as
it is used  is a little too light to express it   good 
ness i call the habit  and goodness of nature  the
inclination   this of all virtues  and dignities of the
mind  is the greatest  being the character of the
deity  and without it  man is a busy  mischievous 
wretched thing  no better than a kind of vermin 
goodness answers to the theological virtue  char 
ity  and admits no excess  but error   the desire of
power in excess  caused the angels to fall  the desire
of knowledge in excess  caused man to fall  but in
charity there is no excess  neither can angel  nor
man  come in dan ger by it   the inclination to good 
ness  is imprinted deeply in the nature of man  in 
somuch  that if it issue not towards men  it will
take unto other living creatures  as it is seen in the
turks  a cruel people  who nevertheless are kind
to beasts  and give alms  to dogs and birds  inso 
much  as busbechius reporteth  a christian boy  in
constantinople  had like to have been stoned  for
gagging in a waggishness a long billed fowl 
errors indeed in this virtue of goodness  or charity 
may be committed   the italians have an ungra 
cious proverb  tanto buon che val niente  so
good  that he is good for nothing   and one of
the doctors of italy  nicholas machiavel  had
the confidence to put in writing  almost in plain
terms  that the christian faith  had given up good
men  in prey to those that are tyrannical and un 
just   which he spake  because indeed there was
never law  or sect  or opinion  did so much mag 
nify goodness  as the christian religion doth 
therefore  to avoid the scandal and the danger
both  it is good  to take knowledge of the errors of
an habit so excellent   seek the good of other men 
but be not in bondage to their faces or fancies  for
that is but facility  or softness  which taketh an
honest mind prisoner   neither give thou aesop s
cock a gem  who would be better pleased  and hap 
pier  if he had had a barley corn   the example of
god  teacheth the lesson truly  he sendeth his rain 
and maketh his sun to shine  upon the just and
unjust  but he doth not rain wealth  nor shine
honor and virtues  upon men equally   common
benefits  are to be communicate with all  but pe 
culiar benefits  with choice   and beware how in
making the portraiture  thou breakest the pattern 
for divinity  maketh the love of ourselves the pat 
tern  the love of our neighbors  but the portraiture 
sell all thou hast  and give it to the poor  and fol 
low me  but  sell not all thou hast  except thou
come and follow me  that is  except thou have a
vocation  wherein thou mayest do as much good 
with little means as with great  for otherwise  in
feeding the streams  thou driest the fountain 
neither is there only a habit of goodness  directed
by right reason  but there is in some men  even in
nature  a disposition towards it  as on the other
side  there is a natural malignity   for there be 
that in their nature do not affect the good of others 
the lighter sort of malignity  turneth but to a
crassness  or frowardness  or aptness to oppose  or
difficulties  or the like  but the deeper sort  to envy
and mere mischief   such men  in other men s ca 
lamities  are  as it were  in season  and are ever on
the loading part  not so good as the dogs  that licked
lazarus  sores  but like flies  that are still buzzing
upon any thing that is raw  misanthropi  that
make it their practice  to bring men to the bough 
and yet never a tree for the purpose in their gar 
dens  as timon had   such dispositions  are the very
errors of human nature  and yet they are the fittest
timber  to make great politics of  like to knee tim 
ber  that is good for ships  that are ordained to be
tossed  but not for building houses  that shall stand
firm   the parts and signs of goodness  are many   if
a man be gracious and courteous to strangers  it
shows he is a citizen of the world  and that his heart
is no island  cut off from other lands  but a conti 
nent  that joins to them   if he be compassionate
towards the afflictions of others  it shows that his
heart is like the noble tree  that is wounded itself 
when it gives the balm   if he easily pardons  and
remits offences  it shows that his mind is planted
above injuries  so that he cannot be shot   if he be
thankful for small benefits  it shows that he weighs
men s minds  and not their trash   but above all  if
he have st  paul s perfection  that he would wish
to be anathema from christ  for the salvation of
his brethren  it shows much of a divine nature  and
a kind of conformity with christ himself





of nobility


we will speak of nobility  first as a portion
of an estate  then as a condition of particu 
lar persons   a monarchy  where there is no nobil 
ity at all  is ever a pure and absolute tyranny  as
that of the turks   for nobility attempers sover 
eignty  and draws the eyes of the people  somewhat
aside from the line royal   but for democracies 
they need it not  and they are commonly more
quiet  and less subject to sedition  than where there
are stirps of nobles   for men s eyes are upon the
business  and not upon the persons  or if upon the
persons  it is for the business  sake  as fittest  and
not for flags and pedigree   we see the switzers last
well  notwithstanding their diversity of religion 
and of cantons   for utility is their bond  and not
respects   the united provinces of the low coun 
tries  in their government  excel  for where there
is an equality  the consultations are more indif 
ferent  and the payments and tributes  more
cheerful   a great and potent nobility  addeth
majesty to a monarch  but diminisheth power 
and putteth life and spirit into the people  but
presseth their fortune   it is well  when nobles are
not too great for sovereignty nor for justice  and
yet maintained in that height  as the insolency of
inferiors may be broken upon them  before it come
on too fast upon the majesty of kings   a numerous
nobility causeth poverty  and inconvenience in a
state  for it is a surcharge of expense  and besides 
it being of necessity  that many of the nobility fall 
in time  to be weak in fortune  it maketh a kind of
disproportion  between honor and means 

as for nobility in particular persons  it is a rev 
erend thing  to see an ancient castle or building 
not in decay  or to see a fair timber tree  sound and
perfect   how much more  to behold an ancient
noble family  which has stood against the waves
and weathers of time  for new nobility is but the
act of power  but ancient nobility is the act of time 
those that are first raised to nobility  are com 
monly more virtuous  but less innocent  than their
descendants  for there is rarely any rising  but by
a commixture of good and evil arts   but it is reason 
the memory of their virtues remain to their pos 
terity  and their faults die with themselves   nobil 
ity of birth commonly abateth industry  and he
that is not industrious  envieth him that is   besides 
noble persons cannot go much higher  and he that
standeth at a stay  when others rise  can hardly
avoid motions of envy   on the other side  nobil 
ity extinguisheth the passive envy from others 
towards them  because they are in possession of
honor   certainly  kings that have able men of
their nobility  shall find ease in employing them 
and a better slide into their business  for people
naturally bend to them  as born in some sort to
command 





of seditions

and troubles



shepherds of people  had need know the
calendars of tempests in state  which are com 
monly greatest  when things grow to equality  as
natural tempests are greatest about the equinoc 
tia   and as there are certain hollow blasts of wind 
and secret swellings of seas before a tempest  so
are there in states 


  ille etiam caecos instare tumultus
saepe monet  fraudesque et operta tunescere bella 


libels and licentious discourses against the state 
when they are frequent and open  and in like sort 
false news often running up and down  to the dis 
advantage of the state  and hastily embraced  are
amongst the signs of troubles   virgil  giving the
pedigree of fame  saith  she was sister to the giants 


illam terra parens  irra irritata deorum 
extremam  ut perhibent  coeo enceladoque sororem
progenuit  


as if fames were the relics of seditions past  but
they are no less  indeed  the preludes of seditions to
come   howsoever he noteth it right  that seditious
tumults  and seditious fames  differ no more but
as brother and sister  masculine and feminine  es 
pecially if it come to that  that the best actions of
a state  and the most plausible  and which ought
to give greatest contentment  are taken in ill sense 
and traduced  for that shows the envy great  as
tacitus saith  conflata magna invidia  seu bene
seu male gesta premunt   neither doth it follow 
that because these fames are a sign of troubles  that
the suppressing of them with too much severity 
should be a remedy of troubles   for the despising
of them  many times checks them best  and the
going about to stop them  doth but make a wonder
long lived   also that kind of obedience  which
tacitus speaketh of  is to be held suspected  erant
in officio  sed tamen qui mallent mandata impe 
rantium interpretari quam exequi  disputing  ex 
cusing  cavilling upon mandates and directions  is
a kind of shaking off the yoke  and assay of dis 
obedience  especially if in those disputings  they
which are for the direction  speak fearfully and
tenderly  and those that are against it  audaciously 

also  as machiavel noteth well  when princes 
that ought to be common parents  make them 
selves as a party  and lean to a side  it is as a boat 
that is overthrown by uneven weight on the one
side  as was well seen  in the time of henry the
third of france  for first  himself entered league
for the extirpation of the protestants  and pres 
ently after  the same league was turned upon him 
self   for when the authority of princes  is made
but an accessory to a cause  and that there be other
bands  that tie faster than the band of sovereignty 
kings begin to be put almost out of possession 

also  when discords  and quarrels  and factions
are carried openly and audaciously  it is a sign the
reverence of government is lost   for the motions
of the greatest persons in a government  ought to
be as the motions of the planets under primum
mobile  according to the old opinion  which is 
that every of them  is carried swiftly by the
highest motion  and softly in their own motion 
and therefore  when great ones in their own
particular motion  move violently  and  as tacitus
expresseth it well  liberius quam ut imperan 
tium meminissent  it is a sign the orbs are out
of frame   for reverence is that  wherewith princes
are girt from god  who threateneth the dissolving
thereof  solvam cingula regum 

so when any of the four pillars of government 
are mainly shaken  or weakened  which are relig 
ion  justice  counsel  and treasure   men had need
to pray for fair weather   but let us pass from this
part of predictions  concerning which  neverthe 
less  more light may be taken from that which
followeth   and let us speak first  of the materials
of seditions  then of the motives of them  and
thirdly of the remedies 

concerning the materials of seditions   it is a
thing well to be considered  for the surest way to
prevent seditions  if the times do bear it  is to take
away the matter of them   for if there be fuel pre 
pared  it is hard to tell  whence the spark shall
come  that shall set it on fire   the matter of sedi 
tions is of two kinds  much poverty  and much dis 
contentment   it is certain  so many overthrown
estates  so many votes for troubles   lucan noteth
well the state of rome before the civil war 


hinc usura vorax  rapidumque in tempore foenus 
hinc concussa fides  et multis utile bellum 


this same multis utile bellum  is an assured and
infallible sign  of a state disposed to seditions and
troubles   and if this poverty and broken estate in
the better sort  be joined with a want and necessity
in the mean people  the danger is imminent and
great   for the rebellions of the belly are the worst 
as for discontentments  they are  in the politic
body  like to humors in the natural  which are apt
to gather a preternatural heat  and to inflame 
and let no prince measure the danger of them by
this  whether they be just or unjust  for that were
to imagine people  to be too reasonable  who do
often spurn at their own good  nor yet by this 
whether the griefs whereupon they rise  be in fact
great or small  for they are the most dangerous
discontentments  where the fear is greater than
the feeling   dolendi modus  timendi non item 
besides  in great oppressions  the same things that
provoke the patience  do withal mate the courage 
but in fears it is not so   neither let any prince  or
state  be secure concerning discontentments  be 
cause they have been often  or have been long  and
yet no peril hath ensued  for as it is true  that every
vapor or fume doth not turn into a storm  so it is
nevertheless true  that storms  though they blow
over divers times  yet may fall at last  and  as the
spanish proverb noteth well  the cord breaketh at
the last by the weakest pull 

the causes and motives of seditions are  innova 
tion in religion  taxes  alteration of laws and cus 
toms  breaking of privileges  general oppression 
advancement of unworthy persons  strangers 
dearths  disbanded soldiers  factions grown des 
perate  and what soever  in offending people 
joineth and knitteth them in a common cause 

for the remedies  there may be some general
preservatives  whereof we will speak  as for the
just cure  it must answer to the particular disease 
and so be left to counsel  rather than rule 

the first remedy or prevention is to remove  by
all means possible  that material cause of sedition
whereof we spake  which is  want and poverty in
the estate   to which purpose serveth the opening 
and well balancing of trade  the cherishing of
manufactures  the banishing of idleness  the re 
pressing of waste  and excess  by sumptuary laws 
the improvement and husbanding of the soil  the
regulating of prices of things vendible  the moder 
ating of taxes and tributes  and the like   generally 
it is to be foreseen that the population of a king 
dom  especially if it be not mown down by wars 
do not exceed the stock of the kingdom  which
should maintain them   neither is the population
to be reckoned only by number  for a smaller num 
ber  that spend more and earn less  do wear out an
estate sooner  than a greater number that live
lower  and gather more   therefore the multiply 
ing of nobility  and other degrees of quality  in an
over proportion to the common people  doth speed 
ily bring a state to necessity  and so doth likewise
an overgrown clergy  for they bring nothing to
the stock  and in like manner  when more are bred
scholars  than preferments can take off  

it is likewise to be remembered  that forasmuch
as the increase of any estate must be upon the
foreigner  for whatsoever is somewhere gotten  is
somewhere lost   there be but three things  which
one nation selleth unto another  the commodity as
nature yieldeth it  the manufacture  and the vec 
ture  or carriage   so that if these three wheels go 
wealth will flow as in a spring tide   and it cometh
many times to pass  that materiam superabit opus 
that the work and carriage is more worth than the
material  and enricheth a state more  as is notably
seen in the low countrymen  who have the best
mines above ground  in the world 

above all things  good policy is to be used  that
the treasure and moneys  in a state  be not gath 
ered into few hands   for otherwise a state may
have a great stock  and yet starve   and money is
like muck  not good except it be spread   this is
done  chiefly by suppressing  or at least keeping
a strait hand  upon the devouring trades of usury 
ingrossing great pasturages  and the like 

for removing discontentments  or at least the
danger of them  there is in every state  as we
know  two portions of subjects  the noblesse and
the commonalty   when one of these is discontent 
the danger is not great  for common people are of
slow motion  if they be not excited by the greater
sort  and the greater sort are of small strength 
except the multitude be apt  and ready to move of
themselves   then is the danger  when the greater
sort  do but wait for the troubling of the waters
amongst the meaner  that then they may declare
themselves   the poets feign  that the rest of the
gods would have bound jupiter  which he hearing
of  by the counsel of pallas  sent for briareus  with
his hundred hands  to come in to his aid   an em 
blem  no doubt  to show how safe it is for mon 
archs  to make sure of the good will of common
people   to give moderate liberty for griefs and dis 
contentments to evaporate  so it be without too
great insolency or bravery   is a safe way   for he
that turneth the humors back  and maketh the
wound bleed inwards  endangereth malign ulcers 
and pernicious imposthumations 

the part of epimetheus mought well become
prometheus  in the case of discontentments  for
there is not a better provision against them   epime 
theus  when griefs and evils flew abroad  at last
shut the lid  and kept hope in the bottom of the
vessel   certainly  the politic and artificial nourish 
ing  and entertaining of hopes  and carrying men
from hopes to hopes  is one of the best antidotes
against the poison of discontentments   and it is a
certain sign of a wise government and proceeding 
when it can hold men s hearts by hopes  when it
cannot by satisfaction  and when it can handle
things  in such manner  as no evil shall appear so
peremptory  but that it hath some outlet of hope 
which is the less hard to do  because both particu 
lar persons and factions  are apt enough to flatter
themselves  or at least to brave that  which they
believe not 

also the foresight and prevention  that there be
no likely or fit head  whereunto discontented per 
sons may resort  and under whom they may join 
is a known  but an excellent point of caution   i
understand a fit head  to be one that hath great 
ness and reputation  that hath confidence with
the discontented party  and upon whom they turn
their eyes  and that is thought discontented  in his
own particular  which kind of persons  are either
to be won  and reconciled to the state  and that in
a fast and true manner  or to be fronted with some
other  of the same party  that may oppose them 
and so divide the reputation   generally  the divid 
ing and breaking  of all factions and combinations
that are adverse to the state  and setting them at
distance  or at least distrust  amongst themselves 
is not one of the worst remedies   for it is a desper 
ate case  if those that hold with the proceeding of
the state  be full of discord and faction  and those
that are against it  be entire and united 

i have noted  that some witty and sharp
speeches  which have fallen from princes  have
given fire to seditions   caesar did himself infinite
hurt in that speech  sylla nescivit literas  non po 
tuit dictare  for it did utterly cut off that hope 
which men had entertained  that he would at one
time or other give over his dictatorship   galba un 
did himself by that speech  legi a se militem  non
emi  for it put the soldiers out of hope of the dona 
tive   probus likewise  by that speech  si vixero 
non opus erit amplius romano imperio militibus 
a speech of great despair for the soldiers   and
many the like   surely princes had need  in tender
matters and ticklish times  to beware what they
say  especially in these short speeches  which fly
abroad like darts  and are thought to be shot out of
their secret intentions   for as for large  discourses 
they are flat things  and not so much noted 


lastly  let princes  against all events  not be
without some great person  one or rather more  of
military valor  near unto them  for the repressing
of seditions in their beginnings   for without that 
there useth to be more trepidation in court upon
the first breaking out of troubles  than were fit 
and the state runneth the danger of that which
tacitus saith  atque is habitus animorum fuit  ut
pessimum facinus auderent pauci  plures vellent 
omnes paterentur   but let such military persons be
assured  and well reputed of  rather than factious
and popular  holding also good correspondence
with the other great men in the state  or else the
remedy  is worse than the disease 





of atheism


i had rather believe all the fables in the leg 
end  and the talmud  and the alcoran  than
that this universal frame is without a mind 
and therefore  god never wrought miracle  to
convince atheism  because his ordinary works con 
vince it   it is true  that a little philosophy inclineth
man s mind to atheism  but depth in philosophy
bringeth men s minds about to religion   for while
the mind of man looketh upon second causes scat 
tered  it may sometimes rest in them  and go no
further  but when it beholdeth the chain of them 
confederate and linked together  it must needs fly
to providence and deity   nay  even that school
which is most accused of atheism doth most dem 
onstrate religion  that is  the school of leucippus
and democritus and epicurus   for it is a thousand
times more credible  that four mutable elements 
and one immutable fifth essence  duly and eter 
nally placed  need no god  than that an army of
infinite small portions  or seeds unplaced  should
have produced this order and beauty  without a
divine marshal   the scripture saith  the fool hath
said in his heart  there is no god  it is not said  the
fool hath thought in his heart  so as he rather saith
it  by rote to himself  as that he would have  than
that he can thoroughly believe it  or be persuaded
of it   for none deny  there is a god  but those  for
whom it maketh that there were no god   it ap 
peareth in nothing more  that atheism is rather in
the lip  than in the heart of man  than by this  that
atheists will ever be talking of that their opinion 
as if they fainted in it  within themselves  and
would be glad to be strengthened  by the consent
of others   nay more  you shall have atheists strive
to get disciples  as it fareth with other sects   and 
which is most of all  you shall have of them  that
will suffer for atheism  and not recant  whereas if
they did truly think  that there were no such thing
as god  why should they trouble themselves  epi 
curus is charged  that he did but dissemble for his
credit s sake  when he affirmed there were blessed
natures  but such as enjoyed themselves  without
having respect to the government of the world 
wherein they say he did temporize  though in
secret  he thought there was no god   but certainly
he is traduced  for his words are noble and divine 
non deos vulgi negare profanum  sed vulgi opini 
ones diis applicare profanum   plato could have
said no more   and although he had the confidence 
to deny the administration  he had not the power 
to deny the nature   the indians of the west  have
names for their particular gods  though they have
no name for god  as if the heathens should have
had the names jupiter  apollo  mars  etc   but not
the word deus  which shows that even those bar 
barous people have the notion  though they have
not the latitude and extent of it   so that against
atheists  the very savages take part  with the very
subtlest philosophers   the contemplative atheist is
rare  a diagoras  a bion  a lucian perhaps  and
some others  and yet they seem to be more than
they are  for that all that impugn a received re 
ligion  or superstition  are by the adverse part
branded with the name of atheists   but the great
atheists  indeed are hypocrites  which are ever
handling holy things  but without feeling  so as
they must needs be cauterized in the end   the
causes of atheism are  divisions in religion  if they
be many  for any one main division  addeth zeal to
both sides  but many divisions introduce atheism 
another is  scandal of priests  when it is come to
that which st  bernard saith  non est jam dicere 
ut populus sic sacerdos  quia nec sic populus ut
sacerdos   a third is  custom of profane scoffing in
holy matters  which doth  by little and little  de 
face the reverence of religion   and lastly  learned
times  specially with peace and prosperity  for
troubles and adversities do more bow men s minds
to religion   they that deny a god  destroy man s
nobility  for certainly man is of kin to the beasts 
by his body  and  if he be not of kin to god  by his
spirit  he is a base and ignoble creature   it destroys
likewise magnanimity  and the raising of human
nature  for take an example of a dog  and mark
what a generosity and courage he will put on 
when he finds himself maintained by a man  who
to him is instead of a god  or melior natura  which
courage is manifestly such  as that creature  with 
out that confidence of a better nature than his own 
could never attain   so man  when he resteth and
assureth himself  upon divine protection and
favor  gathered a force and faith  which human
nature in itself could not obtain   therefore  as
atheism is in all respects hateful  so in this  that it
depriveth human nature of the means to exalt it 
self  above human frailty   as it is in particular
persons  so it is in nations   never was there such a
state for magnanimity as rome   of this state hear
what cicero saith  quam volumus licet  patres con 
scripti  nos amemus  tamen nec numero hispanos 
nec robore gallos  nec calliditate poenos  nec arti 
bus graecos  nec denique hoc ipso hujus gentis et
terrae domestico nativoque sensu italos ipsos et
latinos  sed pietate  ac religione  atque hac una
sapientia  quod deorum immortalium numine
omnia regi gubernarique perspeximus  omnes
gentes nationesque superavimus 




of superstition


it were better to have no opinion of god at all 
than such an opinion  as is unworthy of him 
for the one is unbelief  the other is contumely 
and certainly superstition is the reproach of the
deity   plutarch saith well to that purpose  surely
 saith he  i had rather a great deal  men should
say  there was no such man at all  as plutarch 
than that they should say  that there was one plu 
tarch  that would eat his children as soon as they
were born  as the poets speak of saturn   and as the
contumely is greater towards god  so the danger is
greater towards men   atheism leaves a man to
sense  to philosophy  to natural piety  to laws  to
reputation  all which may be guides to an outward
moral virtue  though religion were not  but super 
stition dismounts all these  and erecteth an abso 
lute monarchy  in the minds of men   therefore
theism did never perturb states  for it makes men
wary of themselves  as looking no further  and we
see the times inclined to atheism  as the time of
augustus caesar  were civil times   but supersti 
tion hath been the confusion of many states  and
bringeth in a new primum mobile  that ravisheth
all the spheres of government the master of super 
stition  is the people  and in all superstition  wise
men follow fools  and arguments are fitted to prac 
tice  in a reversed order   it was gravely said by
some of the prelates in the council of trent  where
the doctrine of the schoolmen bare great sway 
that the schoolmen were like astronomers  which
did feign eccentrics and epicycles  and such en 
gines of orbs  to save the phenomena  though they
knew there were no such things  and in like man 
ner  that the schoolmen had framed a number of
subtle and intricate axioms  and theorems  to save
the practice of the church   the causes of supersti 
tion are  pleasing and sensual rites and ceremonies 
excess of outward and pharisaical holiness  over 
great reverence of traditions  which cannot but
load the church  the stratagems of prelates  for
their own ambition and lucre  the favoring too
much of good intentions  which openeth the gate
to conceits and novelties  the taking an aim at
divine matters  by human  which cannot but
breed mixture of imaginations  and  lastly  bar 
barous times  especially joined with calamities
and disasters   superstition  without a veil  is a de 
formed thing  for  as it addeth deformity to an
ape  to be so like a man  so the similitude of super 
stition to religion  makes it the more deformed 
and as wholesome meat corrupteth to little worms 
so good forms and orders corrupt  into a number of
petty observances   there is a superstition in avoid 
ing superstition  when men think to do best  if they
go furthest from the superstition  formerly re 
ceived  therefore care would be had that  as it
fareth in ill purgings  the good be not taken away
with the bad  which commonly is done  when the
people is the reformer 






of travel


travel  in the younger sort  is a part of edu 
cation  in the elder  a part of experience   he
that travelleth into a country  before he hath some
entrance into the language  goeth to school  and
not to travel   that young men travel under some
tutor  or grave servant  i allow well  so that he be
such a one that hath the language  and hath been
in the country before  whereby he may be able
to tell them what things are worthy to be seen  in
the country where they go  what acquaintances
they are to seek  what exercises  or discipline  the
place yieldeth   for else  young men shall go
hooded  and look abroad little   it is a strange thing 
that in sea voyages  where there is nothing to be
seen  but sky and sea  men should make diaries 
but in land travel  wherein so much is to be ob 
served  for the most part they omit it  as if chance
were fitter to be registered  than observation   let
diaries  therefore  be brought in use   the things to
be seen and observed are  the courts of princes 
especially when they give audience to ambassa 
dors  the courts of justice  while they sit and hear
causes  and so of consistories ecclesiastic  the
churches and monasteries  with the monuments
which are therein extant  the walls and fortifica 
tions of cities  and towns  and so the heavens and
harbors  antiquities and ruins  libraries  colleges 
disputations  and lectures  where any are  ship 
ping and navies  houses and gardens of state and
pleasure  near great cities  armories  arsenals 
magazines  exchanges  burses  warehouses  exer 
cises of horsemanship  fencing  training of sol 
diers  and the like  comedies  such whereunto the
better sort of persons do resort  treasuries of jewels
and robes  cabinets and rarities  and  to conclude 
whatsoever is memorable  in the places where
they go   after all which  the tutors  or servants 
ought to make diligent inquiry   as for triumphs 
masks  feasts  weddings  funerals  capital execu 
tions  and such shows  men need not to be put in
mind of them  yet are they not to be neglected   if
you will have a young man to put his travel into a
little room  and in short time to gather much  this
you must do   first  as was said  he must have some
entrance into the language before he goeth   then
he must have such a servant  or tutor  as knoweth
the country  as was likewise said   let him carry
with him also  some card or book  describing the
country where he travelleth  which will be a good
key to his inquiry   let him keep also a diary   let
him not stay long  in one city or town  more or less
as the place deserveth  but not long  nay  when he
stayeth in one city or town  let him change his
lodging from one end and part of the town  to an 
other  which is a great adamant of acquaintance 
let him sequester himself  from the company of
his countrymen  and diet in such places  where
there is good company of the nation where he
travelleth   let him  upon his removes from one
place to another  procure recommendation to some
person of quality  residing in the place whither he
removeth  that he may use his favor  in those
things he desireth to see or know   thus he may
abridge his travel  with much profit   as for the
acquaintance  which is to be sought in travel  that
which is most of all profitable  is acquaintance
with the secretaries and employed men of ambas 
sadors  for so in travelling in one country  he shall
suck the experience of many   let him also see  and
visit  eminent persons in all kinds  which are of
great name abroad  that he may be able to tell 
how the life agreeth with the fame   for quarrels 
they are with care and discretion to be avoided 
they are commonly for mistresses  healths  place 
and words   and let a man beware   how he keepeth
company with choleric and quarrelsome persons 
for they will engage him into their own quarrels 
when a traveller returneth home  let him not
leave the countries  where he hath travelled  alto 
gether behind him  but maintain a correspond 
ence by letters  with those of his acquaintance 
which are of most worth   and let his travel appear
rather in his discourse  than his apparel or gesture 
and in his discourse  let him be rather advised in
his answers  than forward to tell stories  and let it
appear that he doth not change his country man 
ners  for those of foreign parts  but only prick in
some flowers  of that he hath learned abroad  into
the customs of his own country 




of empire



it is a miserable state of mind  to have few
things to desire  and many things to fear  and
yet that commonly is the case of kings  who  being
at the highest  want matter of desire  which makes
their minds more languishing  and have many rep 
resentations of perils and shadows  which makes
their minds the less clear   and this is one reason
also  of that effect which the scripture speaketh of 
that the king s heart is inscrutable   for multitude
of jealousies  and lack of some predominant de 
sire  that should marshal and put in order all the
rest  maketh any man s heart  hard to find or
sound   hence it comes likewise  that princes many
times make themselves desires  and set their hearts
upon toys  sometimes upon a building  sometimes
upon erecting of an order  sometimes upon the ad 
vancing of a person  sometimes upon obtaining
excellency in some art  or feat of the hand  as nero
for playing on the harp  domitian for certainty
of the hand with the arrow  commodus for play 
ing at fence  caracalla for driving chariots  and
the like   this seemeth incredible  unto those that
know not the principle  that the mind of man  is
more cheered and refreshed by profiting in small
things  than by standing at a stay  in great   we see
also that kings that have been fortunate conquer 
ors  in their first years  it being not possible for
them to go forward infinitely  but that they must
have some check  or arrest in their fortunes  turn
in their latter years to be superstitious  and melan 
choly  as did alexander the great  diocletian  and
in our memory  charles the fifth  and others  for
he that is used to go forward  and findeth a stop 
falleth out of his own favor  and is not the thing
he was 

to speak now of the true temper of empire  it is
a thing rare and hard to keep  for both temper  and
distemper  consist of contraries   but it is one thing 
to mingle contraries  another to interchange them 
the answer of apollonius to vespasian  is full of
excellent instruction   vespasian asked him  what
was nero s overthrow  he answered  nero could
touch and tune the harp well  but in government 
sometimes he used to wind the pins too high  some 
times to let them down too low   and certain it is 
that nothing destroyeth authority so much  as the
unequal and untimely interchange of power
pressed too far  and relaxed too much 

this is true  that the wisdom of all these latter
times  in princes  affairs  is rather fine deliveries 
and shiftings of dangers and mischiefs  when they
are near  than solid and grounded courses to keep
them aloof   but this is but to try masteries with
fortune   and let men beware  how they neglect
and suffer matter of trouble to be prepared  for no
man can forbid the spark  nor tell whence it may
come   the difficulties in princes  business are many
and great  but the greatest difficulty  is often in
their own mind   for it is common with princes
 saith tacitus  to will contradictories  sunt pler 
umque regum voluntates vehementes  et inter se
contrariae   for it is the solecism of power  to think
to command the end  and yet not to endure the
mean 

kings have to deal with their neighbors  their
wives  their children  their prelates or clergy  their
nobles  their second nobles or gentlemen  their
merchants  their commons  and their men of war 
and from all these arise dangers  if care and cir 
cumspection be not used 

first for their neighbors  there can no general
rule be given  for occasions are so variable   save
one  which ever holdeth  which is  that princes do
keep due sentinel  that none of their neighbors do
ever grow so  by increase of territory  by embrac 
ing of trade  by approaches  or the like   as they
become more able to annoy them  than they were 
and this is generally the work of standing coun 
sels  to foresee and to hinder it   during that trium 
virate of kings  king henry the eighth of england 
francis the first king of france  and charles the
fifth emperor  there was such a watch kept  that
none of the three could win a palm of ground  but
the other two would straightways balance it 
either by confederation  or  if need were  by a war 
and would not in any wise take up peace at inter 
est   and the like was done by that league  which
guicciardini saith was the security of italy  made
between ferdinando king of naples  lorenzius
medici  and ludovicus sforza  potentates  the one
of florence  the other of milan   neither is the opin 
ion of some of the schoolmen  to be received  that a
war cannot justly be made  but upon a precedent
injury or provocation   for there is no question  but
a just fear of an imminent danger  though there be
no blow given  is a lawful cause of a war 

for their wives  there are cruel examples of
them   livia is infamed  for the poisoning of her
husband  roxalana  solyman s wife  was the
destruction of that renowned prince  sultan mus 
tapha  and otherwise troubled his house and suc 
cession  edward the second of england  his queen 
had the principal hand in the deposing and mur 
der of her husband   this kind of danger  is then to
be feared chiefly  when the wives have plots  for
the raising of their own children  or else that they
be advoutresses 

for their children  the tragedies likewise of
dangers from them  have been many   and gen 
erally  the entering of fathers into suspicion of
their children  hath been ever unfortunate   the
destruction of mustapha  that we named before 
was so fatal to solyman s line  as the succession of
the turks  from solyman until this day  is sus 
pected to be untrue  and of strange blood  for that
selymus the second  was thought to be supposi 
tious   the destruction of crispus  a young prince of
rare towardness  by constantinus the great  his
father  was in like manner fatal to his house  for
both constantinus and constance  his sons  died
violent deaths  and constantius  his other son  did
little better  who died indeed of sickness  but after
that julianus had taken arms against him   the de 
struction of demetrius  son to philip the second of
macedon  turned upon the father  who died of
repentance   and many like examples there are 
but few or none  where the fathers had good by
such distrust  except it were  where the sons were
up in open arms against them  as was selymus the
first against bajazet  and the three sons of henry
the second  king of england 

for their prelates  when they are proud and
great  there is also danger from them  as it was in
the times of anselmus  and thomas becket  arch 
bishops of canterbury  who  with their croziers 
did almost try it with the king s sword  and yet
they had to deal with stout and haughty kings 
william rufus  henry the first  and henry the
second   the danger is not from that state  but
where it hath a dependence of foreign authority 
or where the churchmen come in and are elected 
not by the collation of the king  or particular
patrons  but by the people 

for their nobles  to keep them at a distance  it is
not amiss  but to depress them  may make a king
more absolute  but less safe  and less able to per 
form  any thing that he desires   i have noted it  in
my history of king henry the seventh of eng 
land  who depressed bis nobility  whereupon it
came to pass  that his times were full of difficulties
and troubles  for the nobility  though they con 
tinued loyal unto him  yet did they not co operate
with him in his business   so that in effect  he was
fain to do all things himself 

for their second nobles  there is not much dan 
ger from them  being a body dispersed   they may
sometimes discourse high  but that doth little hurt 
besides  they are a counterpoise to the higher no 
bility  that they grow not too potent  and  lastly 
being the most immediate in authority  with the
common people  they do best temper popular com 
motions 

for their merchants  they are vena porta  and
if they flourish not  a kingdom may have good
limbs  but will have empty veins  and nourish
little   taxes and imposts upon them  do seldom
good to the king s revenue  for that that he wins in
the hundred  he leeseth in the shire  the particular
rates being increased  but the total bulk of trading 
rather decreased 

for their commons  there is little danger from
them  except it be  where they have great and po 
tent heads  or where you meddle with the point of
religion  or their customs  or means of life 

for their men of war  it is a dangerous state 
where they live and remain in a body  and are
used to donatives  whereof we see examples in the
janizaries  and pretorian bands of rome  but train 
ings of men  and arming them in several places 
and under several commanders  and without
donatives  are things of defence  and no danger 

princes are like to heavenly bodies  which cause
good or evil times  and which have much venera 
tion  but no rest   all precepts concerning kings 
are in effect comprehended in those two remem 
brances  memento quod es homo  and memento
quod es deus  or vice dei  the one bridleth their
power  and the other their will 





of counsel


the greatest trust  between man and man  is
the trust of giving counsel   for in other con 
fidences  men commit the parts of life  their lands 
their goods  their children  their credit  some par 
ticular affair  but to such as they make their coun 
sellors  they commit the whole  by how much the
more  they are obliged to all faith and integrity 
the wisest princes need not think it any diminu 
tion to their greatness  or derogation to their suf 
ficiency  to rely upon counsel   god himself is not
without  but hath made it one of the great names
of his blessed son  the counsellor   solomon hath
pronounced  that in counsel is stability   things
will have their first  or second agitation  if they be
not tossed upon the arguments of counsel  they
will be tossed upon the waves of fortune  and be
full of inconstancy  doing and undoing  like the
reeling of a drunken man   solomon s son found
the force of counsel  as his father saw the necessity
of it   for the beloved kingdom of god  was first
rent  and broken  by ill counsel  upon which coun 
sel  there are set for our instruction  the two marks
whereby bad counsel is for ever best discerned 
that it was young counsel  for the person  and
violent counsel  for the matter 

the ancient times  do set forth in figure  both
the incorporation  and inseparable conjunction  of
counsel with kings  and the wise and politic use of
counsel by kings  the one  in that they say jupi 
ter did marry metis  which signifieth counsel 
whereby they intend that sovereignty  is married
to counsel  the other in that which followeth 
which was thus  they say  after jupiter was mar 
ried to metis  she conceived by him  and was with
child  but jupiter suffered her not to stay  till she
brought forth  but eat her up  whereby he became
himself with child  and was delivered of pallas
armed  out of his head   which monstrous fable
containeth a secret of empire  how kings are to
make use of their counsel of state   that first  they
ought to refer matters unto them  which is the first
begetting  or impregnation  but when they are
elaborate  moulded  and shaped in the womb of
their counsel  and grow ripe  and ready to be
brought forth  that then they suffer not their coun 
sel to go through with the resolution and direc 
tion  as if it depended on them  but take the matter
back into their own hands  and make it appear to
the world  that the decrees and final directions
 which  because they come forth  with prudence
and power  are resembled to pallas armed  pro 
ceeded from themselves  and not only from their
authority  but  the more to add reputation to them 
selves  from their head and device 

let us now speak of the inconveniences of coun 
sel  and of the remedies   the inconveniences that
have been noted  in calling and using counsel  are
three   first  the revealing of affairs  whereby they
become less secret   secondly  the weakening of the
authority of princes  as if they were less of them 
selves   thirdly  the danger of being unfaithfully
counselled  and more for the good of them that
counsel  than of him that is counselled   for which
inconveniences  the doctrine of italy  and practice
of france  in some kings  times  hath introduced
cabinet counsels  a remedy worse than the disease 

as to secrecy  princes are not bound to commu 
nicate all matters  with all counsellors  but may
extract and select   neither is it necessary  that he
that consulteth what he should do  should declare
what he will do   but let princes beware  that the
unsecreting of their affairs  comes not from them 
selves   and as for cabinet counsels  it may be their
motto  plenus rimarum sum  one futile person 
that maketh it his glory to tell  will do more hurt
than many  that know it their duty to conceal   it is
true there be some affairs  which require extreme
secrecy  which will hardly go beyond one or two
persons  besides the king  neither are those coun 
sels unprosperous  for  besides the secrecy  they
conunonly go on constantly  in one spirit of direc 
tion  without distraction   but then it must be a
prudent king  such as is able to grind with a hand 
mill  and those inward counsellors had need also
be wise men  and especially true and trusty to the
king s ends  as it was with king henry the seventh
of england  who  in his great business  imparted
himself to none  except it were to morton and fox 

for weakening of authority  the fable showeth
the remedy   nay  the majesty of kings  is rather
exalted than diminished  when they are in the
chair of counsel  neither was there ever prince  be 
reaved of his dependences  by his counsel  except
where there hath been  either an over greatness
in one counsellor  or an over strict combination in
divers  which are things soon found  and holpen 

for the last inconvenience  that men will coun 
sel  with an eye to themselves  certainly  non
inveniet fidem super terram is meant  of the na 
ture of times  and not of all particular persons 
there be  that are in nature faithful  and sincere 
and plain  and direct  not crafty and involved  let
princes  above all  draw to themselves such na 
tures   besides  counsellors are not commonly so
united  but that one counsellor  keepeth sentinel
over another  so that if any do counsel out of fac 
tion or private ends  it commonly comes to the
king s ear   but the best remedy is  if princes know
their counsellors  as well as their counsellors
know them 


principis est virtus maxima nosse suos 

and on the other side  counsellors should not be
too speculative into their sovereign s person   the
true composition of a counsellor  is rather to be
skilful in their master s business  than in his na 
ture  for then he is like to advise him  and not feed
his humor   it is of singular use to princes  if they
take the opinions of their counsel  both separately
and together   for private opinion is more free 
but opinion before others  is more reverent   in
private  men are more bold in their own humors 
and in consort  men are more obnoxious to others 
humors  therefore it is good to take both  and of
the inferior sort  rather in private  to preserve free 
dom  of the greater  rather in consort  to preserve
respect   it is in vain for princes  to take counsel
concerning matters  if they take no counsel like 
wise concerning persons  for all matters are as
dead images  and the life of the execution of af 
fairs  resteth in the good choice of persons   neither
is it enough  to consult concerning persons secun 
dum genera  as in an idea  or mathematical de 
scription  what the kind and character of the
person should be  for the greatest errors are com 
mitted  and the most judgment is shown  in the
choice of individuals   it was truly said  optimi con 
siliarii mortui  books will speak plain  when coun 
sellors blanch therefore it is good to be conversant
in them  specially the books of such as themselves
have been actors upon the stage 

the counsels at this day  in most places  are but
familiar meetings  where matters are rather talked
on  than debated   and they run too swift  to the
order  or act  of counsel   it were better that in
causes of weight  the matter were propounded one
day  and not spoken to till the next day  in nocte
consilium   so was it done in the commission of
union  between england and scotland  which
was a grave and orderly assembly   i commend set
days for petitions  for both it gives the sudtors more
certainty for their attendance  and it frees the
meetings for matters of estate  that they may hoc
agere   in choice of committees  for ripening busi 
ness for the counsel  it is better to choose indifferent
persons  than to make an indifferency  by putting
in those  that are strong on both sides   i commend
also standing commissions  as for trade  for treas 
ure  for war  for suits  for some provinces  for
where there be divers particular counsels  and but
one counsel of estate  as it is in spain   they are  in
effect  no more than standing commissions  save
that they have greater authority   let such as are
to inform counsels  out of their particular profes 
sions  as lawyers  seamen  mintmen  and the like 
be first heard before committees  and then  as oc 
casion serves  before the counsel   and let them not
come in multitudes  or in a tribunitious manner 
for that is to clamor counsels  not to inform them 
a long table and a square table  or seats about the
walls  seem things of form  but are things of sub 
stance  for at a long table a few at the upper end  in
effect  sway all the business  but in the other form 
there is more use of the counsellors  opinions  that
sit lower   a king  when he presides in counsel  let
him beware how he opens his own inclination too
much  in that which he propoundeth  for else
counsellors will but take the wind of him  and in 
stead of giving free counsel  sing him a song of
placebo 






of delays


fortune is like the market  where many
times if you can stay a little  the price will fall 
again  it is sometimes like sibylla s offer  which at
first  offereth the commodity at full  then con 
sumeth part and part  and still holdeth up the
price   for occasion  as it is in the common verse 
turneth a bald noddle  after she hath presented her
locks in front  and no hold taken  or at least turneth
the handle of the bottle  first to be received  and
after the belly  which is hard to clasp   there is
surely no greater wisdom  than well to time the
beginnings  and onsets  of things   dangers are no
more light  if they once seem light  and more dan 
gers have deceived men  than forced them   nay 
it were better  to meet some dangers half way 
though they come nothing near  than to keep too
long a watch upon their approaches  for if a man
watch too long  it is odds he will fall asleep   on the
other side  to be deceived with too long shadows
 as some have been  when the moon was low  and
shone on their enemies  back   and so to shoot off
before the time  or to teach dangers to come on  by
over early buckling towards them  is another ex 
treme   the ripeness  or unripeness  of the occasion
 as we said  must ever be well weighed  and gener 
ally it is good  to commit the beginnings of all
great actions to argus  with his hundred eyes  and
the ends to briareus  with his hundred hands  first
to watch  and then to speed   for the helmet of
pluto  which maketh the politic man go invisible 
is secrecy in the counsel  and celerity in the execu 
tion   for when things are once come to the execu 
tion  there is no secrecy  comparable to celerity 
like the motion of a bullet in the air  which flieth
so swift  as it outruns the eye 




of cunning


we take cunning for a sinister or crooked
wisdom   and certainly there is a great dif 
ference  between a cunning man  and a wise man 
not only in point of honesty  but in point of ability 
there be  that can pack the cards  and yet cannot
play well  so there are some that are good in can 
vasses and factions  that are otherwise weak men 
again  it is one thing to understand persons  and
another thing to understand matters  for many
are perfect in men s humors  that are not greatly
capable of the real part of business  which is the
constitution of one that hath studied men  more
than books   such men are fitter for practice  than
for counsel  and they are good  but in their own
alley  turn them to new men  and they have lost
their aim  so as the old rule  to know a fool from a
wise man  mitte ambos nudos ad ignotos  et vide 
bis  doth scarce hold for them   and because these
cunning men  are like haberdashers of small
wares  it is not amiss to set forth their shop 

it is a point of cunning  to wait upon him with
whom you speak  with your eye  as the jesuits give
it in precept  for there be many wise men  that
have secret hearts  and transparent countenances 
yet this would be done with a demure abasing of
your eye  sometimes  as the jesuits also do use 

another is  that when you have anything to
obtain  of present despatch  you entertain and
amuse the party  with whom you deal  with some
other discourse  that he be not too much awake to
make objections   i knew a counsellor and secre 
tary  that never came to queen elizabeth of eng 
land  with bills to sign  but he would always first
put her into some discourse of estate  that she
mought the less mind the bills 

the like surprise may be made by moving
things  when the party is in haste  and cannot stay
to consider advisedly of that is moved 

if a man would cross a business  that he doubts
some other would handsomely and effectually
move  let him pretend to wish it well  and move it
himself in such sort as may foil it 

the breaking off  in the midst of that one was
about to say  as if he took himself up  breeds a
greater appetite in him with whom you confer  to
know more 

and because it works better  when anything
seemeth to be gotten from you by question  than
if you offer it of yourself  you may lay a bait for a
question  by showing another visage  and counte 
nance  than you are wont  to the end to give occa 
sion  for the party to ask  what the matter is of the
change  as nehemias did  and i had not before
that time  been sad before the king 

in things that are tender and unpleasing  it is
good to break the ice  by some whose words are of
less weight  and to reserve the more weighty voice 
to come in as by chance  so that he may be asked
the question upon the other s speech  as narcissus
did  relating to claudius the marriage of messa 
lina and silius 

in things that a man would not be seen in him 
self  it is a point of cunning  to borrow the name of
the world  as to say  the world says  or there is a
speech abroad 

i knew one that  when he wrote a letter  he
would put that  which was most material  in the
postscript  as if it had been a by matter 

i knew another that  when he came to have
speech  he would pass over that  that he intended
most  and go forth  and come back again  and
speak of it as of a thing  that he had almost forgot 

some procure themselves  to be surprised  at
such times as it is like the party that they work
upon  will suddenly come upon them  and to be
found with a letter in their hand  or doing some 
what which they are not accustomed  to the end 
they may be apposed of those things  which of
themselves they are desirous to utter 

it is a point of cunning  to let fall those words in
a man s own name  which he would have another
man learn  and use  and thereupon take advan 
tage   i knew two  that were competitors for the
secretary s place in queen elizabeth s time  and
yet kept good quarter between themselves  and
would confer  one with another  upon the busi 
ness  and the one of them said  that to be a secre 
tary  in the declination of a monarchy  was a
ticklish thing  and that he did not affect it  the
other straight caught up those words  and dis 
coursed with divers of his friends  that he had no
reason to desire to be secretary  in the declination
of a monarchy   the first man took hold of it  and
found means it was told the queen  who  hearing
of a declination of a monarchy  took it so ill  as she
would never after hear of the other s suit 

there is a cunning  which we in england call 
the turning of the cat in the pan  which is  when
that which a man says to another  he lays it as if
another had said it to him   and to say truth  it is
not easy  when such a matter passed between two 
to make it appear from which of them it first
moved and began 

it is a way that some men have  to glance and
dart at others  by justifying themselves by nega 
tives  as to say  this i do not  as tigellinus did
towards burrhus  se non  diversas  spes   sed  incolu 
mitatem imperatoris simpliciter spectare 

some have in readiness so many tales and
stories  as there is nothing they would insinuate 
but they can wrap it into a tale  which serveth both
to keep themselves more in guard  and to make
others carry it with more pleasure   it is a good
point of cunning  for a man to shape the answer
he would have  in his own words and propositions 
for it makes the other party stick the less 

it is strange how long some men will lie in wait
to speak somewhat they desire to say  and how far
about they will fetch  and how many other mat 
ters they will beat over  to come near it   it is a thing
of great patience  but yet of much use 

a sudden  bold  and unexpected question doth
many times surprise a man  and lay him open 
like to him that   having changed his name  and
walking in paul s  another suddenly came behind
him  and called him by his true name  whereat
straightways he looked back 

but these small wares  and petty points  of cun 
ning  are infinite  and it were a good deed to make
a list of them  for that nothing doth more hurt in
a state  than that cunning men pass for wise 

but certainly some there are that know the re 
sorts and falls of business  that cannot sink into
the main of it  like a house that hath convenient
stairs and entries  but never a fair room   therefore 
you shall see them find out pretty looses in the con 
clusion  but are no ways able to examine or debate
matters   and yet commonly they take advantage
of their inability  and would be thought wits of
direction   some build rather upon the abusing of
others  and  as we now say  putting tricks upon
them  than upon soundness of their own proceed 
ings   but solomon saith  prudens advertit ad gres 
sus suos  stultus divertit ad dolos 






of wisdom
for a man s self






an ant is a wise creature for itself  but it is a
 shrewd thing  in an orchard or garden   and
certainly  men that are great lovers of themselves 
waste the public   divide with reason  between self 
love and society  and be so true to thyself  as thou
be not false to others  specially to thy king and
country   it is a poor centre of a man s actions  him 
self   it is right earth   for that only stands fast upon
his own centre  whereas all things  that have af 
finity with the heavens  move upon the centre of
another  which they benefit   the referring of all
to a man s self  is more tolerable in a sovereign
prince  because themselves are not only them 
selves  but their good and evil is at the peril of the
public fortune   but it is a desperate evil  in a ser 
vant to a prince  or a citizen in a republic   for
whatsoever affairs pass such a man s hands  he
crooketh them to his own ends  which must needs
be often eccentric to the ends of his master  or state 
therefore  let princes  or states  choose such ser 
vants  as have not this mark  except they mean
their service should be made but the accessory 
that which maketh the effect more pernicious  is
that all proportion is lost   it were disproportion
enough  for the servant s good to be preferred be 
fore the master s  but yet it is a greater extreme 
when a little good of the servant  shall carry things
against a great good of the master s   and yet that
is the case of bad officers  treasurers  ambassadors 
generals  and other false and corrupt servants 
which set a bias upon their bowl  of their own
petty ends and envies  to the overthrow of their
master s great and important affairs   and for the
most part  the good such servants receive  is after
the model of their own fortune  but the hurt they
sell for that good  is after the model of their
master s fortune   and certainly it is the nature of
extreme self lovers  as they will set an house on fire 
and it were but to roast their eggs  and yet these
men many times hold credit with their masters 
because their study is but to please them  and profit
themselves  and for either respect  they will aban 
don the good of their affairs 

wisdom for a man s self is  in many branches
thereof  a depraved thing   it is the wisdom of rats 
that will be sure to leave a house  somewhat before
it fall   it is the wisdom of the fox  that thrusts out
the badger  who digged and made room for him 
it is the wisdom of crocodiles  that shed tears when
they would devour   but that which is specially to
be noted is  that those which  as cicero says of
pompey  are sui amantes  sine rivali  are many
times unfortunate   and whereas they have  all
their times  sacrificed to themselves  they become
in the end  themselves sacrifices to the inconstancy
of fortune  whose wings they thought  by their
self wisdom  to have pinioned 






of innovations


as the births of living creatures  at first are ill 
shapen  so are all innovations  which are the
births of time   yet notwithstanding  as those that
first bring honor into their family  are commonly
more worthy than most that succeed  so the first
precedent  if it be good  is seldom attained by
imitation   for ill  to man s nature  as it stands
perverted  hath a natural motion  strongest in con 
tinuance  but good  as a forced motion  strongest
at first   surely every medicine is an innovation 
and he that will not apply new remedies  must
expect new evils  for time is the greatest innovator 
and if time of course alter things to the worse  and
wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the
better  what shall be the end  it is true  that what
is settled by custom  though it be not good  yet at
least it is fit  and those things which have long
gone together  are  as it were  confederate within
themselves  whereas new things piece not so well 
but though they help by their utility  yet they
trouble by their inconformity   besides  they are
like strangers  more admired  and less favored   all
this is true  if time stood still  which contrariwise
moveth so round  that a froward retention of cus 
tom  is as turbulent a thing as an innovation  and
they that reverence too much old times  are but a
scorn to the new   it were good  therefore  that men
in their innovations would follow the example of
time itself  which indeed innovateth greatly  but
quietly  by degrees scarce to be perceived   for
otherwise  whatsoever is new is unlooked for  and
ever it mends some  and pairs others  and he that
is holpen  takes it for a fortune  and thanks the
time  and he that is hurt  for a wrong  and imput 
eth it to the author   it is good also  not to try experi 
ments in states  except the necessity be urgent  or
the utility evident  and well to beware  that it be
the reformation  that draweth on the change  and
not the desire of change  that pretendeth the refor 
mation   and lastly  that the novelty  though it be
not rejected  yet be held for a suspect  and  as the
scripture saith  that we make a stand upon the
ancient way  and then look about us  and discover
what is the straight and right way  and so to walk
in it 





of dispatch



affected dispatch is one of the most danger 
ous things to business that can be   it is like
that  which the physicians call predigestion  or
hasty digestion  which is sure to fill the body full of
crudities  and secret seeds of diseases   therefore
measure not dispatch  by the times of sitting  but
by the advancement of the business   and as in
races it is not the large stride or high lift that makes
the speed  so in business  the keeping close to the
matter  and not taking of it too much at once  pro 
cureth dispatch   it is the care of some  only to come
off speedily for the time  or to contrive some false
periods of business  because they may seem men
of dispatch   but it is one thing  to abbreviate by
contracting  another by cutting off   and business
so handled  at several sittings or meetings  goeth
commonly backward and forward in an unsteady
manner   i knew a wise man that had it for a by 
word  when he saw men hasten to a conclusion 
stay a little  that we may  make  an  end  the  sooner 

on the other side  true dispatch is a rich thing 
for time is the measure of business  as money is
of wares  and business is bought at a dear hand 
where there is small dispatch   the spartans and
spaniards have been noted to be of small dispatch 
mi venga la muerte de spagna  let my death come
from spain  for then it will be sure to be long in
coming 

give good hearing to those  that give the first
information in business  and rather direct them
in the beginning  than interrupt them in the con 
tinuance of their speeches  for he that is put out of
his own order  will go forward and backward  and
be more tedious  while he waits upon his memory 
than he could have been  if he had gone on in his
own course   but sometimes it is seen  that the
moderator is more troublesome  than the actor 

iterations are commonly loss of time   but there
is no such gain of time  as to iterate often the state
of the question  for it chaseth away many a frivo 
lous speech  as it is coming forth   long and curious
speeches  are as fit for dispatch  as a robe or mantle 
with a long train  is for race   prefaces and pas 
sages  and excusations  and other speeches of refer 
ence to the person  are great wastes of time  and
though they seem to proceed of modesty  they are
bravery   yet beware of being too material  when
there is any impediment or obstruction in men s
wills  for pre occupation of mind ever requireth
preface of speech  like a fomentation to make the
unguent enter 

above all things  order  and distribution  and
singling out of parts  is the life of dispatch  so as the
distribution be not too subtle  for he that doth not
divide  will never enter well into business  and he
that divideth too much  will never come out of it
clearly   to choose time  is to save time  and an un 
seasonable motion  is but beating the air   there be
three parts of business  the preparation  the debate
or examination  and the perfection   whereof  if
you look for dispatch  let the middle only be the
work of many  and the first and last the work of
few   the proceeding upon somewhat conceived in
writing  doth for the most part facilitate dispatch 
for though it should be wholly rejected  yet that
negative is more pregnant of direction  than an
indefinite  as ashes are more generative than dust 









of seeming wise


it hath been an opinion  that the french are
wiser than they seem  and the spaniards seem
wiser than they are   but howsoever it be between
nations  certainly it is so between man and man 
for as the apostle saith of godliness  having a
show of godliness  but denying the power thereof 
so certainly there are  in point of wisdom and suf 
ficiently  that do nothing or little very solemnly 
magno conatu nugas   it is a ridiculous thing  and
fit for a satire to persons of judgment  to see what
shifts these formalists have  and what prospectives
to make superficies to seem body  that hath depth
and bulk   some are so close and reserved  as they
will not show their wares  but by a dark light  and
seem always to keep back somewhat  and when
they know within themselves  they speak of that
they do not well know  would nevertheless seem
to others  to know of that which they may not well
speak   some help themselves with countenance
and gesture  and are wise by signs  as cicero saith
of piso  that when he answered him  he fetched
one of his brows up to his forehead  and bent the
other down to his chin  respondes  altero ad fron 
tem sublato     altero ad mentum depresso super 
cilio  crudelitatem tibi non placere   some think
to bear it by speaking a great word  and being per 
emptory  and go on  and take by admittance  that
which they cannot make good   some  whatsoever
is beyond their reach  will seem to despise  or make
light of it  as impertinent or curious  and so would
have their ignorance seem judgment   some are
never without a difference  and commonly by
amusing men with a subtilty  blanch the matter 
of whom a  gellius saith  hominem delirum  qui
verborum minutiis rerum  frangit pondera   of
which kind also  plato  in his protagoras  bringeth
in prodius in scorn  and maketh him make a
speech  that consisteth of distinction from the be 
ginning to the end   generally  such men in all
deliberations find ease to be of the negative side 
and affect a credit to object and foretell difficul 
ties  for when propositions are denied  there is an
end of them  but if they be allowed  it requireth a
new work  which false point of wisdom is the bane
of business   to conclude  there is no decaying mer 
chant  or inward beggar  hath so many tricks to
uphold the credit of their wealth  as these empty
persons have  to maintain the credit of their suf 
ficiency   seeming wise men may make shift to get
opinion  but let no man choose them for employ 
ment  for certainly you were better take for busi 
ness  a man somewhat absurd  than over formal 


of friendship



it had been hard for him that spake it to have
put more truth and untruth together in few
words  than in that speech  whatsoever is delighted
in solitude  is either a wild beast or a god   for it is
most true  that a natural and secret hatred  and
aversation towards society  in any man  hath
somewhat of the savage beast  but it is most un 
true  that it should have any character at all  of the
divine nature  except it proceed  not out of a pleas 
ure in solitude  but out of a love and desire to
sequester a man s self  for a higher conversation 
such as is found to have been falsely and feignedly
in some of the heathen  as epimenides the can 
dian  numa the roman  empedocles the sicilian 
and apollonius of tyana  and truly and really  in
divers of the ancient hermits and holy fathers of
the church   but little do men perceive what soli 
tude is  and how far it extendeth   for a crowd is
not company  and faces are but a gallery of pic 
tures  and talk but a tinkling cymbal  where
there is no love   the latin adage meeteth with it a
little  magna civitas  magna solitudo  because in
a great town friends are scattered  so that there is
not that fellowship  for the most part  which is in
less neighborhoods   but we may go further  and
affirm most truly  that it is a mere and miserable
solitude to want true friends  without which the
world is but a wilderness  and even in this sense
also of solitude  whosoever in the frame of his
nature and affections  is unfit for friendship  he
taketh it of the beast  and not from humanity 

a principal fruit of friendship  is the ease and
discharge of the fulness and swellings of the heart 
which passions of all kinds do cause and induce 
we know diseases of stoppings  and suffocations 
are the most dangerous in the body  and it is not
much otherwise in the mind  you may take sarza
to open the liver  steel to open the spleen  flowers
of sulphur for the lungs  castoreum for the brain 
but no receipt openeth the heart  but a true friend 
to whom you may impart griefs  joys  fears  hopes 
suspicions  counsels  and whatsoever lieth upon
the heart to oppress it  in a kind of civil shrift or
confession 

it is a strange thing to observe  how high a rate
great kings and monarchs do set upon this fruit of
friendship  whereof we speak  so great  as they
purchase it  many times  at the hazard of their
own safety and greatness   for princes  in regard
of the distance of their fortune from that of their
subjects and servants  cannot gather this fruit  ex 
cept  to make themselves capable thereof  they
raise some persons to be  as it were  companions
and almost equals to themselves  which many
times sorteth to inconvenience   the modern lan 
guages give unto such persons the name of favor 
ites  or privadoes  as if it were matter of grace  or
conversation   but the roman name attaineth the
true use and cause thereof  naming them parti 
cipes curarum  for it is that which tieth the knot 
and we see plainly that this hath been done  not
by weak and passionate princes only  but by the
wisest and most politic that ever reigned  who
have oftentimes joined to themselves some of
their servants  whom both themselves have called
friends  and allowed other likewise to call them in
the same manner  using the word which is re 
ceived between private men 

l  sylla  when he commanded rome  raised
pompey  after surnamed the great  to that height 
that pompey vaunted himself for sylla s over 
match   for when he had carried the consulship for
a friend of his  against the pursuit of sylla  and
that sylla did a little resent thereat  and began to
speak great  pompey turned upon him again  and
in effect bade him be quiet  for that more men
adored the sun rising  than the sun setting   with
julius caesar  decimus brutus had obtained that
interest as he set him down in his testament  for
heir in remainder  after his nephew   and this was
the man that had power with him  to draw him
forth to his death   for when caesar would have
discharged the senate  in regard of some ill pres 
ages  and specially a dream of calpurnia  this
man lifted him gently by the arm out of his chair 
telling him he hoped he would not dismiss the
senate  till his wife had dreamt a better dream 
and it seemeth his favor was so great  as antonius 
in a letter which is recited verbatim in one of
cicero s philippics  calleth him venefica  witch 
as if he had enchanted caesar   augustus raised
agrippa  though of mean birth  to that height  as
when he consulted with maecenas  about the mar 
riage of his daughter julia  maecenas took the
liberty to tell him  that he must either marry his
daughter to agrippa  or take away his life  there
was no third way  he had made him so great   with
tiberius caesar  sejanus had ascended to that
height  as they two were termed  and reckoned  as
a pair of friends   tiberius in a letter to him saith 
haec pro amicitia nostra non occultavi  and the
whole senate dedicated an altar to friendship  as
to a goddess  in respect of the great dearness of
friendship  between them two   the like  or more 
was between septimius severus and plautianus 
for he forced his eldest son to marry the daughter
of plautianus  and would often maintain plau 
tianus  in doing affronts to his son  and did write
also in a letter to the senate  by these words  i love
the man so well  as i wish he may over live me 
now if these princes had been as a trajan  or a
marcus aurelius  a man might have thought that
this had proceeded of an abundant goodness of
nature  but being men so wise  of such strength
and severity of mind  and so extreme lovers of
themselves  as all these were  it proveth most
plainly that they found their own felicity  though
as great as ever happened to mortal men  but as
an half piece  except they mought have a friend 
to make it entire  and yet  which is more  they
were princes that had wives  sons  nephews  and
yet all these could not supply the comfort of friend 
ship 

it is not to be forgotten  what comineus observ 
eth of his first master  duke charles the hardy 
namely  that he would communicate his secrets
with none  and least of all  those secrets which
troubled him most   whereupon he goeth on  and
saith that towards his latter time  that closeness
did impair  and a little perish his understanding 
surely comineus mought have made the same
judgment also  if it had pleased him  of his second
master  lewis the eleventh  whose closeness was
indeed his tormentor   the parable of pythagoras
is dark  but true  cor ne edito  eat not the heart 
certainly  if a man would give it a hard phrase 
those that want friends  to open themselves unto 
are carnnibals of their own hearts   but one thing
is most admirable  wherewith i will conclude this
first fruit of friendship   which is  that this com 
municating of a man s self to his friend  works
two contrary effects  for it redoubleth joys  and
cutteth griefs in halves   for there is no man  that
imparteth his joys to his friend  but he joyeth the
more  and no man that imparteth his griefs to his
friend  but he grieveth the less   so that it is in truth 
of operation upon a man s mind  of like virtue as
the alchemists use to attribute to their stone  for
man s body  that it worketh all contrary effects 
but still to the good and benefit of nature   but yet
without praying in aid of alchemists  there is a
manifest image of this  in the ordinary course of
nature   for in bodies  union strengtheneth and
cherisheth any natural action  and on the other
side  weakeneth and dulleth any violent impres 
sion  and even so it is of minds 

the second fruit of friendship  is healthful and
sovereign for the understanding  as the first is for
the affections   for friendship maketh indeed a fair
day in the affections  from storm and tempests  but
it maketh daylight in the understanding  out of
darkness  and confusion of thoughts   neither is
this to be understood only of faithful counsel 
which a man receiveth from his friend  but before
you come to that  certain it is  that whosoever hath
his mind fraught with many thoughts  his wits
and understanding do clarify and break up  in the
communicating and discoursing with another  he
tosseth his thoughts more easily  he marshalleth
them more orderly  he seeth how they look when
they are turned into words  finally  he waxeth
wiser than himself  and that more by an hour s
discourse  than by a day s meditation   it was well
said by themistocles  to the king of persia  that
speech was like cloth of arras  opened and put
abroad  whereby the imagery doth appear in
figure  whereas in thoughts they lie but as in
packs   neither is this second fruit of friendship  in
opening the understanding  restrained only to
such friends as are able to give a man counsel 
 they indeed are best   but even without that  a
man learneth of himself  and bringeth his own
thoughts  to light  and whetteth his wits as against
a stone  which itself cuts not   in a word  a man
were better relate himself to a statua  or picture 
than to suffer his thoughts to pass in smother 

add now  to make this second fruit of friendship
complete  that other point  which lieth more open 
and falleth within vulgar observation  which is
faithful counsel from a friend   heraclitus saith
well in one of his enigmas  dry light is ever the
best   and certain it is  that the light that a man
receiveth by counsel from another  is drier and
purer  than that which cometh from his own
understanding and judgment  which is ever in 
fused  and drenched  in his affections and customs 
so as there is as much difference between the coun 
sel  that a friend giveth  and that a man giveth
himself  as there is between the counsel of a friend 
and of a flatterer   for there is no such flatterer as
is a man s self  and there is no such remedy against
flattery of a man s self  as the liberty of a friend 
counsel is of two sorts  the one concerning man 
ners  the other concerning business   for the first 
the best preservative to keep the mind in health  is
the faithful admonition of a friend   the calling of
a man s self to a strict account  is a medicine  some 
time too piercing and corrosive   reading good
books of morality  is a little flat and dead   observ 
ing our faults in others  is sometimes improper for
our case   but the best receipt  best  i say  to work 
and best to take  is the admonition of a friend 
it is a strange thing to behold  what gross errors
and extreme absurdities many  especially of the
greater sort  do commit  for want of a friend to tell
them of them  to the great damage both of their
fame and fortune  for  as st  james saith  they are
as men that look sometimes into a glass  and pres 
ently forget their own shape and favor   as for
business  a man may think  if he win  that two
eyes see no more than one  or that a gamester seeth
always more than a looker on  or that a man in
anger  is as wise as he that hath said over the four
and twenty letters  or that a musket may be shot
off as well upon the arm  as upon a rest  and such
other fond and high imaginations  to think him 
self all in all   but when all is done  the help of good
counsel  is that which setteth business straight 
and if any man think that he will take counsel 
but it shall be by pieces  asking counsel in one
business  of one man  and in another business  of
another man  it is well  that is to say  better  per 
haps  than if he asked none at all   but he runneth
two dangers  one  that he shall not be faithfully
counselled  for it is a rare thing  except it be from
a perfect and entire friend  to have counsel given 
but such as shall be bowed and crooked to some
ends  which he hath  that giveth it   the other  that
he shall have counsel given  hurtful and unsafe
 though with good meaning   and mixed partly of
mischief and partly of remedy  even as if you
would call a physician  that is thought good for
the cure of the disease you complain of  but is unac 
quainted with your body  and therefore may put
you in way for a present cure  but overthroweth
your health in some other kind  and so cure the
disease  and kill the patient   but a friend that is
wholly acquainted with a man s estate  will be 
ware  by furthering any present business  how he
dasheth upon other inconvenience   and therefore
rest not upon scattered counsels  they will rather
distract and mislead  than settle and direct 

after these two noble fruits of friendship  peace
in the affections  and support of the judgment  
followeth the last fruit  which is like the pome 
granate  full of many kernels  i mean aid  and
bearing a part  in all actions and occasions   here
the best way to represent to life the manifold use
of friendship  is to cast and see how many things
there are  which a man cannot do himself  and
then it will appear  that it was a sparing speech of
the ancients  to say  that a friend is another him 
self  for that a friend is far more than himself 
men have their time  and die many times  in de 
sire of some things which they principally take to
heart  the bestowing of a child  the finishing of a
work  or the like   if a man have a true friend  he
may rest almost secure that the care of those things
will continue after him   so that a man hath  as it
were  two lives in his desires   a man hath a body 
and that body is confined to a place  but where
friendship is  all offices of life are as it were granted
to him  and his deputy   for he may exercise them
by his friend   how many things are there which
a man cannot  with any face or comeliness  say or
do himself   a man can scarce allege his own
merits with modesty  much less extol them  a man
cannot sometimes brook to supplicate or beg  and
a number of the like   but all these things are grace 
ful  in a friend s mouth  which are blushing in a
man s own   so again  a man s person hath many
proper relations  which he cannot put off   a man
cannot speak to his son but as a father  to his wife
but as a husband  to his enemy but upon terms 
whereas a friend may speak as the case requires 
and not as it sorteth with the person   but to enu 
merate these things were endless  i have given the
rule  where a man cannot fitly play his own part 
if he have not a friend  he may quit the stage 



of expense


riches are for spending  and spending for
honor and good actions   therefore extra 
ordinary expense must be limited by the worth of
the occasion  for voluntary undoing  may be as
well for a man s country  as for the kingdom of
heaven   but ordinary expense  ought to be limited
by a man s estate  and governed with such regard 
as it be within his compass  and not subject to de 
ceit and abuse of servants  and ordered to the best
show  that the bills may be less than the estima 
tion abroad   certainly  if a man will keep but of
even hand  his ordinary expenses ought to be but
to the half of his receipts  and if he think to wax
rich  but to the third part   it is no baseness  for the
greatest to descend and look into their own estate 
some forbear it  not upon negligence alone  but
doubting to bring themselves into melancholy  in
respect they shall find it broken   but wounds can 
not be cured without searching   he that cannot
look into his own estate at all  had need both choose
well those whom he employeth  and change them
often  for new are more timorous and less subtle 
he that can look into his estate but seldom  it be 
hooveth him to turn all to certainties   a man had
need  if he be plentiful in some kind of expense  to
be as saving again in some other   as if he be plenti 
ful in diet  to be saving in apparel  if he be plenti 
ful in the hall  to be saving in the stable  and the
like   for he that is plentiful in expenses of all kinds 
will hardly be preserved from decay   in clearing
of a man s estate  he may as well hurt himself in
being too sudden  as in letting it run on too long 
for hasty selling  is commonly as disadvantage 
able as interest   besides  he that clears at once will
relapse  for finding himself out of straits  he will
revert to his custom  but he that cleareth by de 
grees  induceth a habit of frugality  and gaineth
as well upon his mind  as upon his estate   cer 
tainly  who hath a state to repair  may not despise
small things  and commonly it is less dishonor 
able  to abridge petty charges  than to stoop to
petty gettings   a man ought warily to begin
charges which once begun will continue  but in
matters that return not  he may be more magni 
ficent 




of the true
greatness of king 
doms and estates


the speech of themistocles the athenian 
which was haughty and arrogant  in taking
so much to himself  had been a grave and wise
observation and censure  applied at large to others 
desired at a feast to touch a lute  he said  he could
not fiddle  but yet he could make a small town  a
great city   these words  holpen a little with a
metaphor  may express two differing abilities  in
those that deal in business of estate   for if a true
survey be taken of counsellors and statesmen 
there may be found  though rarely  those which
can make a small state great  and yet cannot fid 
dle  as on the other side  there will be found a great
many  that can fiddle very cunningly  but yet are
so far from being able to make a small state great 
as their gift lieth the other way  to bring a great
and flourishing estate  to ruin and decay   and cer 
tainly whose degenerate arts and shifts  whereby
many counsellors and governors gain both favor
with their masters  and estimation with the vulgar 
deserve no better name than fiddling  being things
rather pleasing for the time  and graceful to them 
selves only  than tending to the weal and advance 
ment of the state which they serve   there are also
 no doubt  counsellors and governors which may
be held sufficient  negotiis pares   able to manage
affairs  and to keep them from precipices and
manifest inconveniences  which nevertheless are
far from the ability to raise and amplify an estate
in power  means  and fortune   but be the workmen
what they may be  let us speak of the work  that
is  the true greatness of kingdoms and estates  and
the means thereof   an argument fit for great and
mighty princes to have in their hand  to the end
that neither by over measuring their forces  they
leese themselves in vain enterprises  nor on the
other side  by undervaluing them  they descend to
fearful and pusillanimous counsels 

the greatness of an estate  in bulk and territory 
doth fall under measure  and the greatness of
finances and revenue  doth fall under computa 
tion   the population may appear by musters  and
the number and greatness of cities and towns by
cards and maps   but yet there is not any thing
amongst civil affairs more subject to error  than
the right valuation and true judgment concerning
the power and forces of an estate   the kingdom of
heaven is compared  not to any great kernel or nut 
but to a grain of mustard seed  which is one of the
least grains  but hath in it a property and spirit
hastily to get up and spread   so are there states 
great in territory  and yet not apt to enlarge or
command  and some that have but a small dimen 
sion of stem  and yet apt to be the foundations of
great monarchies 

walled towns  stored arsenals and armories 
goodly races of horse  chariots of war  elephants 
ordnance  artillery  and the like  all this is but a
sheep in a lion s skin  except the breed and disposi 
tion of the people  be stout and warlike   nay  num 
ber  itself  in armies importeth not much  where
the people is of weak courage  for  as virgil saith 
it never troubles a wolf  how many the sheep be 
the army of the persians  in the plains of arbela 
was such a vast sea of people  as it did somewhat
astonish the commanders in alexander s army 
who came to him therefore  and wished him to set
upon them by night  and he answered  he would
not pilfer the victory   and the defeat was easy 
when tigranes the armenian  being encamped
upon a hill with four hundred thousand men  dis 
covered the army of the romans  being not above
fourteen thousand  marching towards him  he
made himself merry with it  and said  yonder men
are too many for an embassage  and too few for a
fight   but before the sun set  he found them enow
to give him the chase with infinite slaughter 
many are the examples of the great odds  between
number and courage  so that a man may truly
make a judgment  that the principal point of great 
ness in any state  is to have a race of military men 
neither is money the sinews of war  as it is trivially
said   where the sinews of men s arms  in base and
effeminate people  are failing   for solon said well
to croesus  when in ostentation he showed him his
gold   sir  if any other come  that hath better iron 
than you  he will be master of all this gold   there 
fore let any prince or state think solely of his forces 
except his militia of natives be of good and valiant
soldiers   and let princes  on the other side  that
have subjects of martial disposition  know their
own strength  unless they be otherwise wanting
unto themselves   as for mercenary forces  which
is the help in this case   all examples show  that
whatsoever estate or prince doth rest upon them 
he may spread his feathers for a time  but he will
mew them soon after 

the blessing of judah and issachar will never
meet  that the same people  or nation  should be
both the lion s whelp and the ass between bur 
thens  neither will it be  that a people overlaid
with taxes  should ever become valiant and mar 
tial   it is true that taxes levied by consent of the
estate  do abate men s courage less  as it hath been
seen notably  in the excises of the low countries 
and  in some degree  in the subsidies of england 
for you must note  that we speak now of the heart 
and not of the purse   so that although the same
tribute and tax  laid by consent or by imposing  be
all one to the purse  yet it works diversely upon the
courage   so that you may conclude  that no people
overcharged with tribute  is fit for empire 

let states that aim at greatness  take heed how
their nobility and gentlemen do multiply too fast 
for that maketh the common subject  grow to be a
peasant and base swain  driven out of heart  and in
effect but the gentleman s laborer   even as you
may see in coppice woods  if you leave your stad 
dles too thick  you shall never have clean under 
wood  but shrubs and bushes   so in countries   if the
gentlemen be too many  the commons will be base 
and you will bring it to that  that not the hundred
poll  will be fit for an helmet  especially as to the
infantry  which is the nerve of an army  and so
there will be great population  and little strength 
this which i speak of  hath been nowhere better
seen  than by comparing of england and france 
whereof england  though far less in territory and
population  hath been  nevertheless  an over 
match  in regard the middle people of england
make good soldiers  which the peasants of france
do not   and herein the device of king henry the
seventh  whereof i have spoken largely in the
history of his life  was profound and admirable 
in making farms and houses of husbandry of a
standard  that is  maintained with such a propor 
tion of land unto them  as may breed a subject to
live in convenient plenty and no servile condition 
and to keep the plough in the hands of the owners 
and not mere hirelings   and thus indeed you shall
attain to virgil s character which he gives to an 
cient italy 


terra potens armis atque ubere glebae 

neither is that state  which  for any thing i know 
is almost peculiar to england  and hardly to be
found anywhere else  except it be perhaps in
poland  to be passed over  i mean the state of free
servants  and attendants upon noblemen and
gentlemen  which are no ways inferior unto the
yeomanry for arms   and therefore out of all ques 
tions  the splendor and magnificence  and great
retinues and hospitality  of noblemen and gentle 
men  received into custom  doth much conduce
unto martial greatness   whereas  contrariwise  the
close and reserved living of noblemen and gentle 
men  causeth a penury of military forces 

by all means it is to be procured  that the trunk
of nebuchadnezzar s tree of monarchy  be great
enough to bear the branches and the boughs  that
is  that the natural subjects of the crown or state 
bear a sufficient proportion to the stranger sub 
jects  that they govern therefore all states that are
liberal of naturalization towards strangers  are fit
for empire   for to think that an handful of people
can  with the greatest courage and policy in the
world  embrace too large extent of dominion  it
may hold for a time  but it will fail suddenly   the
spartans were a nice people in point of naturaliza 
tion  whereby  while they kept their compass 
they stood firm  but when they did spread  and
their boughs were becomen too great for their
stem  they became a windfall  upon the sudden 
never any state was in this point so open to receive
strangers into their body  as were the romans 
therefore it sorted with them accordingly  for
they grew to the greatest monarchy   their manner
was to grant naturalization  which they called jus
civitatis   and to grant it in the highest degree  that
is  not only jus commercii  jus connubii  jus haere 
ditatis  but also jus suffragii  and jus honorum 
and this not to singular persons alone  but likewise
to whole families  yea to cities  and sometimes to
nations   add to this their custom of plantation of
colonies  whereby the roman plant was removed
into the soil of other nations   and putting both
constitutions together  you will say that it was not
the romans that spread upon the world  but it was
the world that spread upon the romans  and that
was the sure way of greatness   i have marvelled 
sometimes  at spain  how they clasp and contain
so large dominions  with so few natural spaniards 
but sure the whole compass of spain  is a very great
body of a tree  far above rome and sparta at the
first   and besides  though they have not had that
usage  to naturalize liberally  yet they have that
which is next to it  that is  to employ  almost indif 
ferently  all nations in their militia of ordinary
soldiers  yea  and sometimes in their highest com 
mands   nay  it seemeth at this instant they are
sensible  of this want of natives  as by the prag 
matical sanction  now published  appeareth 

it is certain that sedentary  and within door
arts  and delicate manufactures  that require
rather the finger than the arm   have  in their na 
ture  a contrariety to a military disposition   and
generally  all warlike people are a little idle  and
love danger better than travail   neither must they
be too much broken of it  if they shall be preserved
in vigor   therefore it was great advantage  in the
ancient states of sparta  athens  rome  and others 
that they had the use of slaves  which commonly
did rid those manufactures   but that is abolished 
in greatest part  by the christian law   that which
cometh nearest to it  is to leave those arts chiefly to
strangers  which  for that purpose  are the more
easily to be received   and to contain the principal
bulk of the vulgar natives  within those three
kinds    tillers of the ground  free servants  and
handicraftsmen of strong and manly arts  as
smiths  masons  carpenters  etc   not reckoning
professed soldiers 

but above all  for empire and greatness  it im 
porteth most  that a nation do profess arms  as their
principal honor  study  and occupation   for the
things which we formerly have spoken of  are but
habilitations towards arms  and what is habilita 
tion without intention and act  romulus  after his
death  as they report or feign   sent a present to the
romans  that above all  they should intend arms 
and then they should prove the greatest empire of
the world   the fabric of the state of sparta was
wholly  though not wisely  framed and composed 
to that scope and end   the persians and macedo 
nians had it for a flash   the gauls  germans 
goths  saxons  normans  and others  had it for a
time   the turks have it at this day  though in great
declination   of christian europe  they that have it
are  in effect  only the spaniards   but it is so
plain  that every man profiteth in that  he most
intendeth  that it needeth not to be stood upon   it
is enough to point at it  that no nation which doth
not directly profess arms  may look to have great 
ness fall into their mouths   and on the other side 
it is a most certain oracle of time  that those states
that continue long in that profession  as the ro 
mans and turks principally have done  do won 
ders   and those that have professed arms but for
an age  have  notwithstanding  commonly at 
tained that greatness  in that age  which main 
tained them long after  when their profession and
exercise of arms hath grown to decay 

incident to this point is  for a state to have those
laws or customs  which may reach forth unto them
just occasions  as may be pretended  of war   for
there is that justice  imprinted in the nature of
men  that they enter not upon wars  whereof so
many calamities do ensue  but upon some  at the
least specious  grounds and quarrels   the turk
hath at hand  for cause of war  the propagation of
his law or sect  a quarrel that he may always com 
mand   the romans  though they esteemed the
extending the limits of their empire  to be great
honor to their generals  when it was done  yet they
never rested upon that alone  to begin a war   first 
therefore  let nations that pretend to greatness
have this  that they be sensible of wrongs  either
upon borderers  merchants  or politic ministers 
and that they sit not too long upon a provocation 
secondly  let them be prest  and ready to give aids
and succors  to their confederates  as it ever was
with the romans  insomuch  as if the confederate
had leagues defensive  with divers other states 
and  upon invasion offered  did implore their aids
severally  yet the romans would ever be the fore 
most  and leave it to none other to have the honor 
as for the wars which were anciently made  on
the behalf of a kind of party  or tacit conformity of
estate  i do not see how they may be well justified 
as when the romans made a war  for the liberty of
grecia  or when the lacedaemonians and athe 
nians  made wars to set up or pull down democ 
racies and oligarchies  or when wars were made
by foreigners  under the pretence of justice or pro 
tection  to deliver the subjects of others  from
tyranny and oppression  and the like   let it suf 
fice  that no estate expect to be great  that is not
awake upon any just occasion of arming 

no body can be healthful without exercise 
neither natural body nor politic  and certainly to
a kingdom or estate  a just and honorable war  is
the true exercise   a civil war  indeed  is like the
heat of a fever  but a foreign war is like the heat of
exercise  and serveth to keep the body in health 
for in a slothful peace  both courages will effemi 
nate  and manners corrupt   but howsoever it be
for happiness  without all question  for greatness 
it maketh to be still for the most part in arms  and
the strength of a veteran army  though it be a
chargeable business  always on foot  is that which
commonly giveth the law  or at least the reputa 
tion  amongst all neighbor states  as may well be
seen in spain  which hath had  in one part or other 
a veteran army almost continually  now by the
space of six score years 

to be master of the sea  is an abridgment of a
monarchy   cicero  writing to atticus of pompey
his preparation against caesar  saith  consilium
pompeii plane themistocleum est  putat enim 
qui mari potitur  eum rerum potiri   and  without
doubt  pompey had tired out caesar  if upon vain
confidence  he had not left that way   we see the
great effects of battles bv sea   the battle of actium 
decided the empire of the world   the battle of le 
panto  arrested the greatness of the turk   there be
many examples  where sea fights have been final
to the war  but this is when princes or states have
set up their rest  upon the battles   but thus much
is certain  that he that commands the sea  is at
great liberty  and may take as much  and as little 
of the war as he will   whereas those that be strong 
est by land  are many times nevertheless in great
straits   surely  at this day  with us of europe  the
vantage of strength at sea  which is one of the prin 
cipal dowries of this kingdom of great britain  is
great  both because most of the kingdoms of eu 
rope  are not merely inland  but girt with the sea
most part of their compass  and because the wealth
of both indies seems in great part  but an accessory
to the command of the seas 

the wars of latter ages seem to be made in the
dark  in respect of the glory  and honor  which
reflected upon men from the wars  in ancient time 
there be now  for martial encouragement  some
degrees and orders of chivalry  which nevertheless
are conferred promiscuously  upon soldiers and
no soldiers  and some remembrance perhaps  upon
the scutcheon  and some hospitals for maimed sol 
diers  and such like things   but in ancient times 
the trophies erected upon the place of the victory 
the funeral laudatives and monuments for those
that died in the wars  the crowns and garlands per 
sonal  the style of emperor  which the great kings
of the world after borrowed  the triumphs of the
generals  upon their return  the great donatives
and largesses  upon the disbanding of the armies 
were things able to inflame all men s courages 
but above all  that of the triumph  amongst the
romans  was not pageants or gaudery  but one of
the wisest and noblest institutions  that ever was 
for it contained three things  honor to the general 
riches to the treasury out of the spoils  and dona 
tives to the army   but that honor  perhaps were not
fit for monarchies  except it be in the person of the
monarch himself  or his sons  as it came to pass in
the times of the roman emperors  who did impro 
priate the actual triumphs to themselves  and their
sons  for such wars as they did achieve in person 
and left only  for wars achieved by subjects  some
triumphal garments and ensigns to the general 

to conclude  no man can by care taking  as the
scripture saith  add a cubit to his stature  in this
little model of a man s body  but in the great frame
of kingdoms and commonwealths  it is in the
power of princes or estates  to add amplitude and
greatness to their kingdoms  for by introducing
such ordinances  constitutions  and customs  as we
have now touched  they may sow greatness to
their posterity and succession   but these things are
commonly not observed  but left to take their
chance 





of regiment

of health





there is a wisdom in this  beyond the rules of
physic  a man s own observation  what he
finds good of  and what he finds hurt of  is the best
physic to preserve health   but it is a safer conclu 
sion to say  this agreeth not well with me  there 
fore  i will not continue it  than this  i find no
offence of this  therefore i may use it   for strength
of nature in youth  passeth over many excesses 
which are owing a man till his age   discern of the
coming on of years  and think not to do the same
things still  for age will not be defied   beware of
sudden change  in any great point of diet  and  if
necessity enforce it  fit the rest to it   for it is a secret
both in nature and state  that it is safer to change
many things  than one   examine thy customs of
diet  sleep  exercise  apparel  and the like  and try 
in any thing thou shalt judge hurtful  to discon 
tinue it  by little and little  but so  as if thou dost
find any inconvenience by the change  thou come
back to it again  for it is hard to distinguish that
which is generally held good and wholesome 
from that which is good particularly  and fit for
thine own body   to be free minded and cheerfully
disposed  at hours of meat  and of sleep  and of
exercise  is one of the best precepts of long lasting 
as for the passions  and studies of the mind  avoid
envy  anxious fears  anger fretting inwards 
subtle and knotty inquisitions  joys and exhilara 
tions in excess  sadness not communicated   enter 
tain hopes  mirth rather than joy  variety of
delights  rather than surfeit of them  wonder and
admiration  and therefore novelties  studies that
fill the mind with splendid and illustrious objects 
as histories  fables  and contemplations of nature 
if you fly physic in health altogether  it will be too
strange for your body  when you shall need it   if
you make it too familiar  it will work no extra 
ordinary effect  when sickness cometh   i commend
rather some diet for certain seasons  than frequent
use of physic  except it be grown into a custom   for
those diets alter the body more  and trouble it less 
despise no new accident in your body  but ask
opinion of it   in sickness  respect health prin 
cipally  and in health  action   for those that put
their bodies to endure in health  may in most sick 
nesses  which are not very sharp  be cured only
with diet  and tendering   celsus could never have
spoken it as a physician  had he not been a wise
man withal  when he giveth it for one of the great
precepts of health and lasting  that a man do vary 
and interchange contraries  but with an inclina 
tion to the more benign extreme  use fasting and
full eating  but rather full eating  watching and
sleep  but rather sleep  sitting and exercise  but
rather exercise  and the like   so shall nature be
cherished  and yet taught masteries   physicians
are  some of them  so pleasing and conformable to
the humor of the patient  as they press not the true
cure of the disease  and some other are so regular 
in proceeding according to art for the disease  as
they respect not sufficiently the condition of the
patient   take one of a middle temper  or if it may
not be found in one man  combine two of either
sort  and forget not to call as well  the best ac 
quainted with your body  as the best reputed of
for his faculty 




of suspicion


suspicions amongst thoughts  are like bats
amongst birds  they ever fly by twilight   cer 
tainly they are to be repressed  or at least well
guarded  for they cloud the mind  they leese
friends  and they check with business  whereby
business cannot go on currently and constantly 
they dispose kings to tyranny  husbands to jeal 
ousy  wise men to irresolution and melancholy 
they are defects  not in the heart  but in the brain 
for they take place in the stoutest natures  as in the
example of henry the seventh of england   there
was not a more suspicious man  nor a more stout 
and in such a composition they do small hurt   for
commonly they are not admitted  but with exami 
nation  whether they be likely or no   but in fearful
natures they gain ground too fast   there is nothing
makes a man suspect much  more than to know
little  and therefore men should remedy suspicion 
by procuring to know more  and not to keep their
suspicions in smother   what would men have  do
they think  those they  employ and deal with  are
saints  do they not think  they will have their own
ends  and be truer to themselves  than to them 
therefore there is no better way  to moderate sus 
picions  than to account upon such suspicions as
true  and yet to bridle them as false   for so far a
man ought to make use of suspicions  as to provide 
as if that should be true  that he suspects  yet it
may do him no hurt   suspicions that the mind of
itself gathers  are but buzzes  but suspicions that
are artificially nourished  and put into men s
heads  by the tales and whisperings of others  have
stings   certainly  the best mean  to clear the way
in this same wood of suspicions  is frankly to com 
municate them with the party  that he suspects 
for thereby he shall be sure to know more of the
truth of them  than he did before  and withal shall
make that party more circumspect  not to give
further cause of suspicion   but this would not be
done to men of base natures  for they  if they find
themselves once suspected  will never be true   the
italian says  sospetto licentia fede  as if suspicion 
did give a passport to faith  but it ought  rather  to
kindle it to discharge itself 



of discourse


some  in their discourse   desire rather com 
mendation of wit  in being able to hold all
arguments  than of judgment  in discerning what
is true  as if it were a praise  to know what might
be said  and not  what should be thought   some
have certain common places  and themes  wherein
they are good and want variety  which kind of
poverty is for the most part tedious  and when it is
once perceived  ridiculous   the honorablest part of
talk   is to give the occasion  and again to moderate 
and pass to somewhat else  for then a man leads the
dance   it is good  in discourse and speech of con 
versation   to vary and intermingle speech of the
present occasion  with arguments  tales with rea 
sons  asking of questions  with telling of opinions 
and jest with earnest  for it is a dull thing to tire 
and  as we say now  to jade  any thing too far   as
for jest  there be certain things  which ought to be
privileged from it  namely  religion  matters of
state  great persons  any man s present business of
importance  and any case that deserveth pity   yet
there be some  that think their wits have been
asleep  except they dart out somewhat that is
piquant  and to the quick   that is a vein which
would be bridled 


parce  puer  stimulis  et fortius utere loris 


and generally  men ought to find the difference 
between saltness and bitterness   certainly  he that
hath a satirical vein  as he maketh others afraid of
his wit  so he had need be afraid of others  memory 
he that questioneth much  shall learn much  and
content much  but especially  if he apply his ques 
tions to the skill of the persons whom he asketh  for
he shall give them occasion  to please themselves
in speaking  and himself shall continually gather
knowledge   but let his questions not be trouble 
some  for that is fit for a poser   and let him be sure
to leave other men  their turns to speak   nay  if
there be any  that would reign and take up all
the time  let him find means to take them off 
and to bring others on  as musicians use to do  with
those that dance too long galliards   if you dis 
semble  sometimes  your knowledge of that you
are thought to know  you shall be thought  another
time  to know that you know not   speech of a
man s self ought to be seldom  and well chosen   i
knew one  was wont to say in scorn  he must needs
be a wise man  he speaks so much of himself  and
there is but one case  wherein a man may com 
mend himself with good grace  and that is in
commending virtue in another  especially if it be
such a virtue  whereunto himself pretendeth 
speech of touch towards others  should be spar 
ingly used  for discourse ought to be as a field 
without coming home to any man   i knew two
noblemen  of the west part of england  whereof
the one was given to scoff  but kept ever royal cheer
in his house  the other would ask  of those that had
been at the other s table  tell truly  was there never
a flout or dry blow given  to which the guest
would answer  such and such a thing passed 
the lord would say  i thought  he would mar a
good dinner   discretion of speech  is more than
eloquence  and to speak agreeably to him  with
whom we deal  is more than to speak in good
words  or in good order   a good continued speech 
without a good speech of interlocution  shows
slowness  and a good reply or second speech  with 
out a good settled speech  showeth shallowness
and weakness   as we see in beasts  that those that
are weakest in the course  are yet nimblest in the
turn  as it is betwixt the greyhound and the hare 
to use too many circumstances  ere one come to
the matter  is wearisome  to use none at all  is
blunt 




of plantations


plantations are amongst ancient  primi 
tive  and heroical works   when the world was
young  it begat more children  but now it is old  it
begets fewer  for i may justly account new plan 
tations  to be the children of former kingdoms   i
like a plantation in a pure soil  that is  where
people are not displanted  to the end  to plant in
others   for else it is rather an extirpation  than a
plantation   planting of countries  is like planting
of woods  for you must make account to leese al 
most twenty years  profit  and expect your recom 
pense in the end   for the principal thing  that hath
been the destruction of most plantations  hath
been the base and hasty drawing of profit  in the
first years   it is true  speedy profit is not to be neg 
lected  as far as may stand with the good of the
plantation  but no further   it is a shameful and
unblessed thing  to take the scum of people  and
wicked condemned men  to be the people with
whom you plant  and not only so  but it spoileth
the plantation  for they will ever live like rogues 
and not fall to work  but be lazy  and do mischief 
and spend victuals  and be quickly weary  and
then certify over to their country  to the discredit
of the plantation   the people wherewith you
plant ought to be gardeners  ploughmen  laborers 
smiths  carpenters  joiners  fishermen  fowlers 
with some few apothecaries  surgeons  cooks  and
bakers   in a country of plantation  first look about 
what kind of victual the country yields of itself to
hand  as chestnuts  walnuts  pineapples  olives 
dates  plums  cherries  wild honey  and the like 
and make use of them   then consider what victual
or esculent things there are  which grow speedily 
and within the year  as parsnips  carrots  turnips 
onions  radish  artichokes of hierusalem  maize 
and the like   for wheat  barley  and oats  they ask
too much labor  but with pease and beans you may
begin  both because they ask less labor  and be 
cause they serve for meat  as well as for bread   and
of rice  likewise cometh a great increase  and it is
a kind of meat   above all  there ought to be brought
store of biscuit  oat meal  flour  meal  and the like 
in the beginning  till bread may be had   for beasts 
or birds  take chiefly such as are least subject to
diseases  and multiply fastest  as swine  goats 
cocks  hens  turkeys  geese  house doves  and the
like   the victual in plantations  ought to be ex 
pended almost as in a besieged town  that is  with
certain allowance   and let the main part of the
ground  employed to gardens or corn  be to a com 
mon stock  and to be laid in  and stored up  and
then delivered out in proportion  besides some
spots of ground  that any particular person will
manure for his own private   consider likewise
what commodities  the soil where the plantation
is  doth naturally yield  that they may some way
help to defray the charge of the plantation  so it be
not  as was said  to the untimely prejudice of the
main business   as it hath fared with tobacco in
virginia   wood commonly aboundeth but too
much  and therefore timber is fit to be one   if there
be iron ore  and streams whereupon to set the mills 
iron is a brave commodity where wood aboundeth 
making of bay salt  if the climate be proper for it 
would be put in experience   growing silk likewise 
if any be  is a likely commodity   pitch and tar 
where store of firs and pines are  will not fail   so
drugs and sweet woods  where they are  cannot
but yield great profit   soap ashes likewise  and
other things that may be thought of   but moil not
too much under ground  for the hope of mines is
very uncertain  and useth to make the planters
lazy  in other things   for government  let it be in
the hands of one  assisted with some counsel  and
let them have commission to exercise martial laws 
with some limitation   and above all  let men make
that profit  of being in the wilderness  as they have
god always  and his service  before their eyes   let
not the government of the plantation  depend
upon too many counsellors  and undertakers  in
the country that planteth  but upon a temperate
number  and let those be rather noblemen and
gentlemen  than merchants  for they look ever to
the present gain   let there be freedom from cus 
tom  till the plantation be of strength  and not
only freedom from custom  but freedom to carry
their commodities  where they may make their
best of them  except there be some special cause of
caution   cram not in people  by sending too fast
company after company  but rather harken how
they waste  and send supplies proportionably  but
so  as the number may live well in the plantation 
and not by surcharge be in penury   it hath been a
great endangering to the health of some planta 
tions  that they have built along the sea and rivers 
in marish and unwholesome grounds   therefore 
though you begin there  to avoid carriage and
like discommodities  yet build still rather upwards
from the streams  than along   it concerneth like 
wise the health of the plantation  that they have
good store of salt with them  that they may use it
in their victuals  when it shall be necessary   if you
plant where savages are  do not only entertain
them  with trifles and gingles  but use them justly
and graciously  with sufficient guard nevertheless 
and do not win their favor  by helping them to in 
vade their enemies  but for their defence it is not
amiss  and send oft of them  over to the country
that plants  that they may see a better condition
than their own  and commend it when they re 
turn   when the plantation grows to strength  then
it is time to plant with women  as well as with
men  that the plantation may spread into genera 
tions  and not be ever pieced from without   it is the
sinfullest thing in the world  to forsake or destitute
a plantation once in forwardness  for besides the
dishonor  it is the guiltiness of blood of many com 
miserable persons 






of riches


i cannot call riches better than the baggage
of virtue   the roman word is better  impedi 
menta   for as the baggage is to an army  so is riches
to virtue   it cannot be spared  nor left behind  but
it hindereth the march  yea  and the care of it 
sometimes loseth or disturbeth the victory   of
great riches there is no real use  except it be in the
distribution  the rest is but conceit   so saith solo 
mon  where much is  there are many to consume
it  and what hath the owner  but the sight of it
with his eyes  the personal fruition in any man 
cannot reach to feel great riches  there is a custody
of them  or a power of dole  and donative of them 
or a fame of them  but no solid use to the owner 
do you not see what feigned prices  are set upon
little stones and rarities  and what works of osten 
tation are undertaken  because there might seem
to be some use of great riches  but then you will
say  they may be of use  to buy men out of dangers
or troubles   as solomon saith  riches are as a
strong hold  in the imagination of the rich man 
but this is excellently expressed  that it is in imagi 
nation  and not always in fact   for certainly great
riches  have sold more men  than they have bought
out   seek not proud riches  but such as thou mayest
get justly  use soberly  distribute cheerfully  and
leave contentedly   yet have no abstract nor friarly
contempt of them   but distinguish  as cicero saith
well of rabirius posthumus  in studio rei ampli 
ficandae apparebat  non avaritiae praedam  sed
instrumentum bonitati quaeri   harken also to
solomon  and beware of hasty gathering of riches 
qui festinat ad divitias  non erit insons   the poets
feign  that when plutus  which is riches  is sent
from jupiter  he limps and goes slowly  but when
he is sent from pluto  he runs  and is swift of foot 
meaning that riches gotten by good means  and
just labor  pace slowly  but when they come by
the death of others  as by the course of inheritance 
testaments  and the like   they come tumbling
upon a man   but it mought be applied likewise to
pluto  taking him for the devil   for when riches
come from the devil  as by fraud and oppression 
and unjust means   they come upon speed   the
ways to enrich are many  and most of them foul 
parsimony is one of the best  and yet is not inno 
cent  for it withholdeth men from works of liberal 
ity and charity   the improvement of the ground 
is the most natural obtaining of riches  for it is our
great mother s blessing  the earth s  but it is slow 
and yet where men of great wealth do stoop to
husbandry  it multiplieth riches exceedingly   i
knew a nobleman in england  that had the great 
est audits of any man in my time  a great grazier 
a great sheep master  a great timber man  a great
collier  a great corn master  a great lead man  and
so of iron  and a number of the like points of hus 
bandry   so as the earth seemed a sea to him  in
respect of the perpetual importation   it was truly
observed by one  that himself came very hardly 
to a little riches  and very easily  to great riches 
for when a man s stock is come to that  that he can
expect the prime of markets  and overcome those
bargains  which for their greatness are few men s
money  and be partner in the industries of younger
men  he cannot but increase mainly   the gains of
ordinary trades and vocations are honest  and
furthered by two things chiefly  by diligence  and
by a good name  for good and fair dealing   but the
gains of bargains  are of a more doubtful nature 
when men shall wait upon others  necessity  broke
by servants and instruments to draw them on  put
off others cunningly  that would be better chap 
men  and the like practices  which are crafty and
naught   as for the chopping of bargains  when a
man buys not to hold but to sell over again  that
commonly grindeth double  both upon the seller 
and upon the buyer   sharings do greatly enrich 
if the hands be well chosen  that are trusted   usury
is the certainest means of gain  though one of the
worst  as that whereby a man doth eat his bread 
in sudore vultus alieni  and besides  doth plough
upon sundays   but yet certain though it be  it hath
flaws  for that the scriveners and brokers do value
unsound men  to serve their own turn   the fortune
in being the first  in an invention or in a privilege 
doth cause sometimes a wonderful overgrowth in
riches  as it was with the first sugar man  in the
canaries   therefore if a man can play the true
logician  to have as well judgment  as invention 
he may do great matters  especially if the times be
fit   he that resteth upon gains certain  shall hardly
grow to great riches  and he that puts all upon
adventures  doth oftentimes break and come to
poverty  it is good  therefore  to guard adventures
with certainties  that may uphold losses   monopo 
lies  and coemption of wares for re sale  where
they are not restrained  are great means to enrich 
especially if the party have intelligence  what
things are like to come into request  and so store
himself beforehand   riches gotten by service 
though it be of the best rise  yet when they are
gotten by flattery  feeding humors  and other serv 
ile conditions  they may be placed amongst the
worst   as for fishing for testaments and executor 
ships  as tacitus saith of seneca  testamenta et
orbos tamquam indagine capi   it is yet worse  by
how much men submit themselves to meaner per 
sons  than in service   believe not much  them that
seem to despise riches  for they despise them  that
despair of them  and none worse  when they come
to them   be not penny wise  riches have wings 
and sometimes they fly away of themselves  some 
times they must be set flying  to bring in more 
men leave their riches  either to their kindred  or
to the public  and moderate portions  prosper best
in both   a great state left to an heir  is as a lure to
all the birds of prey round about  to seize on him  if
he be not the better stablished in years and judg 
ment   likewise glorious gifts and foundations  are
like sacrifices without salt  and but the painted
sepulchres of alms  which soon will putrefy  and
corrupt inwardly   therefore measure not thine
advancements  by quantity  but frame them by
measure  and defer not charities till death  for 
certainly  if a man weigh it rightly  he that doth
so  is rather liberal of another man s  than of his
own 


of prophecies



i mean not to speak of divine prophecies  nor
of heathen oracles  nor of natural predictions 
but only of prophecies that have been of cer 
tain memory  and from hidden causes   saith the
pythonissa to saul  to morrow thou and thy son
shall be with me   homer hath these verses 


at domus aeneae cunctis dominabitur oris 
et nati natorum  et qui nascentur ab illis 


a prophecy  as it seems  of the roman empire 
seneca the tragedian hath these verses 


    venient annis
saecula seris  quibus oceanus
vincula rerum laxet  et ingens
pateat tellus  tiphysque novos
detegat orbes  nec sit terris
ultima thule 


a prophecy of the discovery of america   the daugh 
ter of polycrates  dreamed that jupiter bathed her
father  and apollo anointed him  and it came to
pass  that he was crucified in an open place  where
the sun made his body run with sweat  and the
rain washed it   philip of macedon dreamed  he
sealed up bis wife s belly  whereby he did expound
it  that his wife should be barren  but aristander
the soothsayer  told him his wife was with child 
because men do not use to seal vessels  that are
empty   a phantasm that appeared to m  brutus  in
his tent  said to him  philippis iterum me videbis 
tiberius said to galba  tu quoque  galba  degusta 
bis imperium   in vespasian s time  there went a
prophecy in the east  that those that should come
forth of judea  should reign over the world 
which though it may be was meant of our savior 
yet tacitus expounds it of vespasian   domitian
dreamed  the night before he was slain  that a
golden head was growing  out of the nape of his
neck  and indeed  the succession that followed him
for many years  made golden times   henry the
sixth of england  said of henry the seventh  when
he was a lad  and gave him water  this is the lad
that shall enjoy the crown  for which we strive 
when i was in france  i heard from one dr  pena 
that the queen mother  who was given to curious
arts  caused the king her husband s nativity to be
calculated  under a false name  and the astrologer
gave a judgment  that he should be killed in a duel 
at which the queen laughed  thinking her hus 
band to be above challenges and duels  but he was
slain upon a course at tilt  the splinters of the staff
of montgomery going in at his beaver   the trivial
prophecy  which i heard when i was a child  and
queen elizabeth was in the flower of her years 
was 


when hempe is spun

england s done 

whereby it was generally conceived  that after the
princes had reigned  which had the principal
letters of that word hempe  which were henry 
edward  mary  philip  and elizabeth   england
should come to utter confusion  which  thanks be
to god  is verified only in the change of the name 
for that the king s style  is now no more of eng 
land but of britain   there was also another proph 
ecy  before the year of  88  which i do not well
understand 


there shall be seen upon a day 
between the baugh and the may 
the black fleet of norway 
when that that is come and gone 
england build houses of lime and stone 
for after wars shall you have none 


it was generally conceived to be meant  of the
spanish fleet that came in  88  for that the king of
spain s surname  as they say  is norway   the pre 
diction of regiomontanus 


octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus 


was thought likewise accomplished in the sending
of that great fleet  being the greatest in strength 
though not in number  of all that ever swam upon
the sea   as for cleon s dream  i think it was a jest 
it was  that he was devoured of a long dragon  and
it was expounded of a maker of sausages  that
troubled him exceedingly   there are numbers of
the like kind  especially if you include dreams  and
predictions of astrology   but i have set down these
few only  of certain credit  for example   my judg 
ment is  that they ought all to be despised  and
ought to serve but for winter talk by the fireside 
though when i say despised  i mean it as for be 
lief  for otherwise  the spreading  or publishing 
of them  is in no sort to be despised   for they have
done much mischief  and i see many severe laws
made  to suppress them   that that hath given them
grace  and some credit  consisteth in three things 
first  that men mark when they hit  and never
mark when they miss  as they do generally also of
dreams   the second is  that probable conjectures 
or obscure traditions  many times turn themselves
into prophecies  while the nature of man  which
coveteth divination  thinks it no peril to foretell
that which indeed they do but collect   as that of
seneca s verse   for so much was then subject to
demonstration  that the globe of the earth had
great parts beyond the atlantic  which mought
be probably conceived not to be all sea  and adding
thereto the tradition in plato s timaeus  and his
atlanticus  it mought encourage one to turn it to
a prediction   the third and last  which is the great
one  is  that almost all of them  being infinite in
number  have been impostures  and by idle and
crafty brains merely contrived and feigned  after
the event past 




of ambition



ambition is like choler  which is an humor
that maketh men active  earnest  full of alac 
rity  and stirring  if it be not stopped   but if it be
stopped  and cannot have his way  it becometh
adust  and thereby malign and venomous   so am 
bitious men  if they find the way open for their
rising  and still get forward  they are rather busy
than dangerous  but if they be checked in their
desires  they become secretly discontent  and look
upon men and matters with an evil eye  and are
best pleased  when things go backward  which is
the worst property in a servant of a prince  or state 
therefore it is good for princes  if they use ambi 
tious men  to handle it  so as they be still progres 
sive and not retrograde  which  because it cannot
be without inconvenience  it is good not to use such
natures at all   for if they rise not with their service 
they will take order  to make their service fall with
them   but since we have said  it were good not to
use men of ambitious natures  except it be upon
necessity  it is fit we speak  in what cases they are
of necessity   good commanders in the wars must
be taken  be they never so ambitious  for the use
of their service  dispenseth with the rest  and to
take a soldier without ambition  is to pull off his
spurs   there is also great use of ambitious men  in
being screens to princes in matters of danger and
envy  for no man will take that part  except he be
like a seeled dove  that mounts and mounts  be 
cause he cannot see about him   there is use also of
ambitious men  in pulling down the greatness of
any subject that overtops  as tiberius used marco 
in the pulling down of sejanus   since  therefore 
they must be used in such cases  there resteth to
speak  how they are to be bridled  that they may be
less dangerous   there is less danger of them  if they
be of mean birth  than if they be noble  and if they
be rather harsh of nature  than gracious and popu 
lar  and if they be rather new raised  than grown
cunning  and fortified  in their greatness   it is
counted by some  a weakness in princes  to have
favorites  but it is  of all others  the best remedy
against ambitious great ones   for when the way
of pleasuring  and displeasuring  lieth by the
favorite  it is impossible any other should be over 
great   another means to curb them  is to balance
them by others  as proud as they   but then there
must be some middle counsellors  to keep things
steady  for without that ballast  the ship will roll
too much   at the least  a prince may animate
and inure some meaner persons  to be as it were
scourges  to ambitions men   as for the having of
them obnoxious to ruin  if they be of fearful
natures  it may do well  but if they be stout and
daring  it may precipitate their designs  and prove
dangerous   as for the pulling of them down  if the
affairs require it  and that it may not be done with
safety suddenly  the only way is the interchange 
continually  of favors and disgraces  whereby
they may not know what to expect  and be  as it
were  in a wood   of ambitions  it is less harmful 
the ambition to prevail in great things  than that
other  to appear in every thing  for that breeds
confusion  and mars business   but yet it is less dan 
ger  to have an ambitious man stirring in business 
than great in dependences   he that seeketh to be
eminent amongst able men  hath a great task  but
that is ever good for the public   but he  that plots
to be the only figure amongst ciphers  is the decay
of a whole age   honor hath three things in it  the
vantage ground to do good  the approach to kings
and principal persons  and the raising of a man s
own fortunes   he that hath the best of these inten 
tions  when he aspireth  is an honest man  and that
prince  that can discern of these intentions in an 
other that aspireth  is a wise prince   generally  let
princes and states choose such ministers  as are
more sensible of duty than of using  and such as
love business rather upon conscience  than upon
bravery  and let them discern a busy nature  from
a willing mind 


of masques

and triumphs





these things are but toys  to come amongst
such serious observations   but yet  since
princes will have such things  it is better they
should be graced with elegancy  than daubed with
cost   dancing to song  is a thing of great state and
pleasure   i understand it  that the song be in quire 
placed aloft  and accompanied with some broken
music  and the ditty fitted to the device   acting in
song  especially in dialogues  hath an extreme
good grace  i say acting  not dancing  for that is a
mean and vulgar thing   and the voices of the dia 
logue would be strong and manly  a base and a
tenor  no treble   and the ditty high and tragical 
not nice or dainty   several quires  placed one over
against another  and taking the voice by catches 
anthem wise  give great pleasure   turning dances
into figure  is a childish curiosity   and generally
let it be noted  that those things which i here set
down  are such as do naturally take the sense  and
not respect petty wonderments   it is true  the al 
terations of scenes  so it be quietly and without
noise  are things of great beauty and pleasure  for
they feed and relieve the eye  before it be full of
the same object   let the scenes abound with light 
specially colored and varied  and let the masquers 
or any other  that are to come down from the
scene  have some motions upon the scene itself 
before their coming down  for it draws the eye
strangely  and makes it  with great pleasure  to
desire to see  that it cannot perfectly discern   let
the songs be loud and cheerful  and not chirpings
or pulings   let the music likewise be sharp and
loud  and well placed   the colors that show best by
candle light are white  carnation  and a kind of
sea water green  and oes  or spangs  as they are of
no great cost  so they are of most glory   as for rich
embroidery  it is lost and not discerned   let the
suits of the masquers be graceful  and such as be 
come the person  when the vizors are off  not after
examples of known attires  turke  soldiers  mari 
ners   and the like   let anti masques not be long 
they have been commonly of fools  satyrs  baboons 
wild men  antics  beasts  sprites  witches  ethiops 
pigmies  turquets  nymphs  rustics  cupids  statuas
moving  and the like   as for angels  it is not comi 
cal enough  to put them in anti masques  and
anything that is hideous  as devils  giants  is on
the other side as unfit   but chiefly  let the music
of them be recreative  and with some strange
changes   some sweet odors suddenly coming forth 
without any drops falling  are  in such a company
as there is steam and heat  things of great pleasure
and refreshment   double masques  one of men 
another of ladies  addeth state and variety   but all
is nothing except the room be kept clear and neat 

for justs  and tourneys  and barriers  the glories
of them are chiefly in the chariots  wherein the
challengers make their entry  especially if they
be drawn with strange beasts  as lions  bears 
camels  and the like  or in the devices of their en 
trance  or in the bravery of their liveries  or in the
goodly furniture of their horses and armor   but
enough of these toys 





of nature

in men



nature is often hidden  sometimes over 
come  seldom extinguished   force  maketh
nature more violent in the return  doctrine and dis 
course  maketh nature less importune  but custom
only doth alter and subdue nature   he that seeketh
victory over his nature  let him not set himself too
great  nor too small tasks  for the first will make
him dejected by often failings  and the second will
make him a small proceeder  though by often pre 
vailings   and at the first let him practise with
helps  as swimmers do with bladders or rushes 
but after a time let him practise with disadvan 
tages  as dancers do with thick shoes   for it breeds
great perfection  if the practice be harder than the
use   where nature is mighty  and therefore the
victory hard  the degrees had need be  first to stay
and arrest nature in time  like to him that would
say over the four and twenty letters when he was
angry  then to go less in quantity  as if one should 
in forbearing wine  come from drinking healths 
to a draught at a meal  and lastly  to discontinue
altogether   but if a man have the fortitude  and
resolution  to enfranchise himself at once  that is
the best 


optimus ille animi vindex laedentia pectus
vincula qui rupit  dedoluitque semel 


neither is the ancient rule amiss  to bend nature 
as a wand  to a contrary extreme  whereby to set it
right  understanding it  where the contrary ex 
treme is no vice   let not a man force a habit upon
himself  with a perpetual continuance  but with
some intermission   for both the pause reinforceth
the new onset  and if a man that is not perfect  be
ever in practice  he shall as well practise his errors 
as his abilities  and induce one habit of both  and
there is no means to help this  but by seasonable
intermissions   but let not a man trust his victory
over his nature  too far  for nature will lay buried
a great time  and yet revive  upon the occasion or
temptation   like as it was with aesop s damsel 
turned from a cat to a woman  who sat very de 
mutely at the board s end  till a mouse ran before
her   therefore  let a man either avoid the occasion
altogether  or put himself often to it  that he may
be little moved with it   a man s nature is best per 
ceived in privateness  for there is no affectation 
in passion  for that putteth a man out of his pre 
cepts  and in a new case or experiment  for there
custom leaveth him   they are happy men  whose
natures sort with their vocations  otherwise they
may say  multum incola fuit anima mea  when
they converse in those things  they do not affect 
in studies  whatsoever a man commandeth upon
himself  let him set hours for it  but whatsoever is
agreeable to his nature  let him take no care for
any set times  for his thoughts will fly to it  of
themselves  so as the spaces of other business  or
studies  will suffice   a man s nature  runs either to
herbs or weeds  therefore let him seasonably water
the one  and destroy the other 




of custom

and education





men s thoughts  are much according to their
inclination  their discourse and speeches 
according to their learning and infused opinions 
but their deeds  are after as they have been accus 
tomed   and therefore  as machiavel well noteth
 though in an evil favored instance   there is no
trusting to the force of nature  nor to the bravery
of words  except it be corroborate by custom   his
instance is  that for the achieving of a desperate
conspiracy  a man should not rest upon the fierce 
ness of any man s nature  or his resolute under 
takings  but take such an one  as hath had his
hands formerly in blood   but machiavel knew not
of a friar clement  nor a ravillac  nor a jaureguy 
nor a baltazar gerard  yet his rule holdeth still 
that nature  nor the engagement of words  are not
so forcible  as custom   only superstition is now so
well advanced  that men of the first blood  are as
firm as butchers by occupation  and votary reso 
lution  is made equipollent to custom  even in mat 
ter of blood   in other things  the predominancy of
custom is everywhere visible  insomuch as a man
would wonder  to hear men profess  protest  en 
gage  give great words  and then do  just as they
have done before  as if they were dead images 
and engines moved only by the wheels of custom 
we see also the reign or tyranny of custom  what
it is   the indians  i mean the sect of their wise men 
lay themselves quietly upon a stock of wood  and
so sacrifice themselves by fire   nay  the wives
strive to be burned  with the corpses of their hus 
bands   the lads of sparta  of ancient time  were
wont to be scourged upon the altar of diana  with 
out so much as queching   i remember  in the be 
ginning of queen elizabeth s time of england  an
irish rebel condemned  put up a petition to the
deputy  that he might be hanged in a withe  and
not in an halter  because it had been so used  with
former rebels   there be monks in russia  for pen 
ance  that will sit a whole night in a vessel of water 
till they be engaged with hard ice   many examples
may be put of the force of custom  both upon mind
and body   therefore  since custom is the principal
magistrate of man s life  let men by all means en 
deavor  to obtain good customs   certainly custom
is most perfect  when it beginneth in young years 
this we call education  which is  in effect  but an
early custom   so we see  in languages  the tongue
is more pliant to all expressions and sounds  the
joints are more supple  to all feats of activity and
motions   in youth than afterwards   for it is true 
that late learners cannot so well take the ply  ex 
cept it be in some minds  that have not suffered
themselves to fix  but have kept themselves open 
and prepared to receive continual amendment 
which is exceeding rare   but if the force of cus 
tom simple and separate  be great  the force of
custom copulate and conjoined and collegiate  is
far greater   for there example teacheth  company
comforteth  emulation quickeneth  glory raiseth 
so as in such places the force of custom is in his
exaltation   certainly the great multiplication of
virtues upon human nature  resteth upon socie 
ties well ordained and disciplined   for common 
wealths  and good governments  do nourish virtue
grown but do not much mend the deeds   but the
misery is  that the most effectual means  are now
applied to the ends  least to be desired 


of fortune


it cannot be denied  but outward accidents
conduce much to fortune  favor  opportunity 
death of others  occasion fitting virtue   but chiefly 
the mould of a man s fortune is in his own hands 
faber quisque fortunae suae  saith the poet   and
the most frequent of external causes is  that the
folly of one man  is the fortune of another   for no
man prospers so suddenly  as by others  errors 
serpens nisi serpentem comederit non fit draco 
overt and apparent virtues  bring forth praise  but
there be secret and hidden virtues  that bring forth
fortune  certain deliveries of a man s self  which
have no name   the spanish name  desemboltura 
partly expresseth them  when there be not stonds
nor restiveness in a man s nature  but that the
wheels of his mind  keep way with the wheels of
his fortune   for so livy  after he had described
cato major in these words  in illo viro tantum ro 
bur corporis et animi fuit  ut quocunque loco natus
esset  fortunam sibi facturus videretur  falleth
upon that  that he had versatile ingenium   there 
fore if a man look sharply and attentively  he shall
see fortune  for though she be blind  yet she is not
invisible   the way of fortune  is like the milken
way in the sky  which is a meeting or knot of a
number of small stars  not seen asunder  but giv 
ing light together   so are there a number of
little  and scarce discerned virtues  or rather facul 
ties and customs  that make men fortunate   the
italians note some of them  such as a man would
little think   when they speak of one that cannot do
amiss  they will throw in  into his other conditions 
that he hath poco di matto   and certainly there be
not two more fortunate properties  than to have a
little of the fool  and not too much of the honest 
therefore extreme lovers of their country or
masters  were never fortunate  neither can they
be  for when a man placeth his thoughts without
himself  he goeth not his own way   an hasty for 
tune maketh an enterpriser and remover  the
french hath it better  entreprenant  or remuant  
but the exercised fortune maketh the able man 
fortune is to be honored and respected  and it be
but for her daughters  confidence and reputation 
for those two  felicity breedeth  the first within
a man s self  the latter in others towards him   all
wise men  to decline the envy of their own virtues 
use to ascribe them to providence and fortune  for
so they may the better assume them  and  besides 
it is greatness in a man  to be the care of the higher
powers   so caesar said to the pilot in the tempest 
caesarem portas  et fortunam ejus   so sylla chose
the name of felix  and not of magnus   and it hath
been noted  that those who ascribe openly too
much to their own wisdom and policy  end infor 
tunate   it is written that timotheus the athenian 
after he had  in the account he gave to the state of
his government  often interlaced this speech  and
in this  fortune had no part  never prospered in
anything  he undertook afterwards   certainly
there be  whose fortunes are like homer s verses 
that have a slide and easiness more than the verses
of other poets  as plutarch saith of timoleon s for 
tune  in respect of that of agesilaus or epaminon 
das   and that this shoulld be  no doubt it is much 
in a man s self 






of usury


many have made witty invectives against
usury   they say that it is a pity  the devil
should have god s part  which is the tithe   that the
usurer is the greatest sabbath breaker  because his
plough goeth every sunday   that the usurer is the
drone  that virgil speaketh of 


ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent 

that the usurer breaketh the first law  that was
made for mankind after the fall  which was  in
sudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum  not  in
sudore vultus alieni   that usurers should have
orange tawny bonnets  because they do judaize 
that it is against nature for money to beget money 
and the like   i say this only  that usury is a conces 
sum propter duritiem cordis  for since there must
be borrowing and lending  and men are so hard
of heart  as they will not lend freely  usury must
be permitted   some others  have made suspicious
and cunning propositions of banks  discovery of
men s estates  and other inventions   but few have
spoken of usury usefully   it is good to set before us 
the incommodities and commodities of usury  that
the good  may be either weighed out or culled out 
and warily to provide  that while we make forth
to that which is better  we meet not with that
which is worse 

the discommodities of usury are  first  that it
makes fewer merchants   for were it not for this
lazy trade of usury  money would not he still  but
would in great part be employed upon merchan 
dizing  which is the vena porta of wealth in a state 
the second  that it makes poor merchants   for  as
a farmer cannot husband his ground so well  if he
sit at a great rent  so the merchant cannot drive
his trade so well  if he sit at great usury   the third
is incident to the other two  and that is the decay of
customs of kings or states  which ebb or flow  with
merchandizing   the fourth  that it bringeth the
treasure of a realm  or state  into a few hands   for
the usurer being at certainties  and others at uncer 
tainties  at the end of the game  most of the money
will be in the box  and ever a state flourisheth 
when wealth is more equally spread   the fifth 
that it beats down the price of land  for the em 
ployment of money  is chiefly either merchandiz 
ing or purchasing  and usury waylays both   the
sixth  that it doth dull and damp all industries  im 
provements  and new inventions  wherein money
would be stirring  if it were not for this slug   the
last  that it is the canker and ruin of many men s
estates  which  in process of time  breeds a public
poverty 

on the other side  the commodities of usury are 
first  that howsoever usury in some respect hinder 
eth merchandizing  yet in some other it advanceth
it  for it is certain that the greatest part of trade is
driven by young merchants  upon borrowing at
interest  so as if the usurer either call in  or keep
back  his money  there will ensue  presently  a
great stand of trade   the second is  that were it not
for this easy borrowing upon interest  men s neces 
sities would draw upon them a most sudden un 
doing  in that they would be forced to sell their
means  be it lands or goods  far under foot  and so 
whereas usury doth but gnaw upon them  bad
markets would swallow them quite up   as for
mortgaging or pawning  it will little mend the
matter  for either men will not take pawns with 
out use  or if they do  they will look precisely for
the forfeiture   i remember a cruel moneyed man
in the country  that would say  the devil take this
usury  it keeps us from forfeitures  of mortgages
and bonds   the third and last is  that it is a vanity
to conceive  that there would be ordinary borrow 
ing without profit  and it is impossible to conceive 
the number of inconveniences that will ensue  if
borrowing be cramped   therefore to speak of the
abolishing of usury is idle   all states have ever had
it  in one kind or rate  or other   so as that opinion
must be sent to utopia 

to speak now of the reformation  and reigle 
ment  of usury  how the discommodities of it may
be best avoided  and the commodities retained   it
appears  by the balance of commodities and dis 
commodities of usury  two things are to be recon 
ciled   the one  that the tooth of usury be grinded 
that it bite not too much  the other  that there be
left open a means  to invite moneyed men to lend
to the merchants  for the continuing and quicken 
ing of trade   this cannot be done  except you intro 
duce two several sorts of usury  a less and a greater 
for if you reduce usury to one low rate  it will ease
the common borrower  but the merchant will be
to seek for money   and it is to be noted  that the
trade of merchandize  being the most lucrative 
may bear usury at a good rate  other contracts
not so 

to serve both intentions  the way would be
briefly thus   that there be two rates of usury 
the one free  and general for all  the other under
license only  to certain persons  and in certain
places of merchandizing   first  therefore  let usury
in general  be reduced to five in the hundred  and
let that rate be proclaimed  to be free and current 
and let the state shut itself out  to take any penalty
for the same   this will preserve borrowing  from
any general stop or dryness   this will ease infinite
borrowers in the country   this will  in good part 
raise the price of land  because land purchased
at sixteen years  purchase will yield six in the
hundred  and somewhat more  whereas this rate
of interest  yields but five   this by like reason
will encourage  and edge  industrious and profit 
able improvements  because many will rather
venture in that kind  than take five in the hun 
dred  especially having been used to greater profit 
secondly  let there be certain persons licensed 
to lend to known merchants  upon usury at a
higher rate  and let it be with the cautions fol 
lowing   let the rate be  even with the merchant
himself  somewhat more easy than that he used
formerly to pay  for by that means  all bor 
rowers  shall have some ease by this reformation 
be he merchant  or whosoever   let it be no
bank or common stock  but every man be master
of his own money   not that i altogether mis 
like banks  but they will hardly be brooked  in
regard of certain suspicions   let the state be
answered some small matter for the license  and
the rest left to the lender  for if the abatement be
but small  it will no whit discourage the lender 
for he  for example  that took before ten or nine in
the hundred  will sooner descend to eight in the
hundred than give over his trade of usury  and go
from certain gains  to gains of hazard   let these
licensed lenders be in number indefinite  but re 
strained to certain principal cities and towns of
merchandizing  for then they will be hardly able
to color other men s moneys in the country  so as
the license of nine will not suck away the current
rate of five  for no man will send his moneys far
off  nor put them into unknown hands 

if it be objected that this doth in a sort authorize
usury  which before  was in some places but per 
missive  the answer is  that it is better to mitigate
usury  by declaration  than to suffer it to rage  by
connivance 









of youth

and age


a man that is young in years  may be old in
hours  if he have lost no time   but that hap 
peneth rarely   generally  youth is like the first
cogitations  not so wise as the second   for there is
a youth in thoughts  as well as in ages   and yet the
invention of young men  is more lively than that
of old  and imaginations stream into their minds
better  and  as it were  more divinely   natures that
have much heat  and great and violent desires and
perturbations  are not ripe for action  till they have
passed the meridian of their years  as it was with
julius caesar and septimius severus   of the latter 
of whom it is said  juventutem egit erroribus  imo
furoribus  plenam   and yet he was the ablest em 
peror  almost  of all the list   but reposed natures
may do well in youth   as it is seen in augustus
caesar  cosmus duke of florence  gaston de foix 
and others   on the other side  heat and vivacity in
age  is an excellent composition for business 
young men are fitter to invent  than to judge  fitter
for execution  than for counsel  and fitter for new
projects  than for settled business   for the experi 
ence of age  in things that fall within the compass
of it  directeth them  but in new things  abuseth
them 

the errors of young men  are the ruin of busi 
ness  but the errors of aged men  amount but to
this  that more might have been done  or sooner 
young men  in the conduct and manage of actions 
embrace more than they can hold  stir more than
they can quiet  fly to the end  without considera 
tion of the means and degrees  pursue some
few principles  which they have chanced upon
absurdly  care not to innovate  which draws un 
known inconveniences  use extreme remedies at
first  and  that which doubleth all errors  will not
acknowledge or retract them  like an unready
horse  that will neither stop nor turn   men of age
object too much  consult too long  adventure too
little  repent too soon  and seldom drive business
home to the full period  but content themselves
with a mediocrity of success   certainly it is good to
compound employments of both  for that will be
good for the present  because the virtues of either
age  may correct the defects of both  and good for
succession  that young men may be learners  while
men in age are actors  and  lastly  good for extern
accidents  because authority followeth old men 
and favor and popularity  youth   but for the moral
part  perhaps youth will have the pre eminence  as
age hath for the politic   a certain rabbin  upon the
text  your young men shall see visions  and your
old men shall dream dreams  inferreth that young
men  are admitted nearer to god than old  because
vision  is a clearer revelation  than a dream   and
certainly  the more a man drinketh of the world 
the more it intoxicateth  and age doth profit rather
in the powers of understanding  than in the virtues
of the will and affections   there be some  have an
over early ripeness in their years  which fadeth
betimes   these are  first  such as have brittle wits 
the edge whereof is soon turned  such as was her 
mogenes the rhetorician  whose books are exceed 
ing subtle  who afterwards waxed stupid   a second
sort  is of those that have some natural dispositions
which have better grace in  youth  than in age 
such as is a fluent and luxuriant speech  which
becomes youth well  but not age  so tully saith of
hortensius  idem manebat  neque idem decebat 
the third is of such  as take too high a strain at the
first  and are magnanimous  more than tract of
years can uphold   as was scipio africanus  of
whom livy saith in effect  ultima primis cedebant 






of beauty


virtue is like a rich stone  best plain set  and
surely virtue is best  in a body that is comely 
though not of delicate features  and that hath
rather dignity of presence  than beauty of aspect 
neither is it almost seen  that very beautiful per 
sons are otherwise of great virtue  as if nature were
rather busy  not to err  than in labor to produce
excellency   and therefore they prove accom 
plished  but not of great spirit  and study rather
behavior  than virtue   but this holds not always 
for augustus caesar  titus vespasianus  philip le
belle of france  edward the fourth of england 
alcibiades of athens  ismael the sophy of persia 
were all high and great spirits  and yet the most
beautiful men of their times   in beauty  that of
favor  is more than that of color  and that of decent
and gracious motion  more than that of favor   that
is the best part of beauty  which a picture cannot
express  no  nor the first sight of the life   there is no
excellent beauty  that hath not some strangeness
in the proportion   a man cannot tell whether
apelles  or albert durer  were the more trifler 
whereof the one  would make a personage by geo 
metrical proportions  the other  by taking the best
parts out of divers faces  to make one excellent 
such personages  i think  would please nobody 
but the painter that made them   not but i think a
painter may make a better face than ever was  but
he must do it by a kind of felicity  as a musician
that maketh an excellent air in music   and not by
rule   a man shall see faces  that if you examine
them part by part  you shall find never a good 
and yet altogether do well   if it be true that the
principal part of beauty is in decent motion  cer 
tainly it is no marvel  though persons in years
seem many times more amiable  pulchrorum
autumnus pulcher  for no youth can be comely
but by pardon  and considering the youth  as to
make up the comeliness   beauty is as summer
fruits   which are easy to corrupt  and cannot last 
and for the most part it makes a dissolute youth 
and an age a little out of countenance  but yet cer 
tainly again  if it light well  it maketh virtue shine 
and vices blush 


of deformity



deformed persons are commonly even with
nature  for as nature hath done ill by them 
so do they by nature  being for the most part  as
the scripture saith  void of natural affection  and
so they have their revenge of nature   certainly
there is a consent  between the body and the mind 
and where nature erreth in the one  she ventureth
in the other   ubi peccat in uno  periclitatur in al 
tero   but because there is  in man  an election
touching the frame of his mind  and a necessity in
the frame of his body  the stars of natural inclina 
tion are sometimes obscured  by the sun of disci 
pline and virtue   therefore it is good to consider of
deformity  not as a sign  which is more deceivable 
but as a cause  which seldom faileth of the effect 
whosoever hath anything fixed in his person  that
doth induce contempt  hath also a perpetual spur
in himself  to rescue and deliver himself from
scorn   therefore all deformed persons  are extreme
bold   first  as in their own defence  as being ex 
posed to scorn  but in process of time  by a general
habit   also it stirreth in them industry  and espe 
cially of this kind  to watch and observe the weak 
ness of others  that they may have somewhat to
repay   again  in their superiors  it quencheth
jealousy towards them  as persons that they think
they may  at pleasure  despise  and it layeth their
competitors and emulators asleep  as never believ 
ing they should be in possibility of advancement 
till they see them in possession   so that upon the
matter  in a great wit  deformity is an advantage
to rising   kings in ancient times  and at this pres 
ent in some countries  were wont to put great trust
in eunuchs  because they that are envious towards
all are more obnoxious and officious  towards one 
but yet their trust towards them  hath rather
been as to good spials  and good wbisperers  than
good magistrates and officers   and much like is
the reason of deformed persons   still the ground
is  they will  if they be of spirit  seek to free them 
selves from scorn  which must be either by virtue
or malice  and therefore let it not be marvelled  if
sometimes they prove excellent persons  as was
agesilaus  zanger the son of solyman  aesop 
gasca  president of peru  and socrates may go
likewise amongst them  with others 


of building



houses are built to live in  and not to look on 
therefore let use be preferred before uni 
formity  except where both may be had   leave
the goodly fabrics of houses  for beauty only  to
the enchanted palaces of the poets  who build them
with small cost   he that builds a fair house  upon
an ill seat  committeth himself to prison   neither
do i reckon it an ill seat  only where the air is un 
wholesome  but likewise where the air is unequal 
as you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of
ground  environed with higher hills round about
it  whereby the heat of the sun is pent in  and the
wind gathereth as in troughs  so as you shall have 
and that suddenly  as great diversity of heat and
cold as if you dwelt in several places   neither is it
ill air only that maketh an ill seat  but ill ways  ill
markets  and  if you will consult with momus  ill
neighbors   i speak not of many more  want of
water  want of wood  shade  and shelter  want of
fruitfulness  and mixture of grounds of several
natures  want of prospect  want of level grounds 
want of places at some near distance for sports of
hunting  hawking  and races  too near the sea  too
remote  having the commodity of navigable rivers 
or the discommodity of their overflowing  too far
off from great cities  which may hinder business 
or too near them  which lurcheth all provisions 
and maketh everything dear  where a man hath
a great living laid together  and where he is
scanted  all which  as it is impossible perhaps to
find together  so it is good to know them  and think
of them  that a man may take as many as he can 
and if he have several dwellings  that he sort them
so  that what he wanteth in the one  he may find in
the other   lucullus answered pompey well  who 
when he saw his stately galleries  and rooms so
large and lightsome  in one of his houses  said 
surely an excellent place for summer  but how do
you in winter  lucullus answered  why  do you
not think me as wise as some fowl are  that ever
change their abode towards the winter 

to pass from the seat  to the house itself  we will
do as cicero doth in the orator s art  who writes
books de oratore  and a book he entitles orator 
whereof the former  delivers the precepts of the
art  and the latter  the perfection   we will there 
fore describe a princely palace  making a brief
model thereof   for it is strange to see  now in
europe  such huge buildings as the vatican and
escurial and some others be  and yet scarce a very
fair room in them 

first  therefore  i say you cannot have a perfect
palace except you have two several sides  a side for
the banquet  as it is spoken of in the book of hester 
and a side for the household  the one for feasts and
triumphs  and the other for dwelling   i understand
both these sides to be not only returns  but parts
of the front  and to be uniform without  though
severally partitioned within  and to be on both
sides of a great and stately tower  in the midst of
the front  that  as it were  joineth them together
on either hand   i would have on the side of the ban 
quet  in front  one only goodly room above stairs 
of some forty foot high  and under it a room for a
dressing  or preparing place  at times of triumphs 
on the other side  which is the household side  i
wish it divided at the first  into a hall and a chapel
 with a partition between   both of good state and
bigness  and those not to go all the length  but to
have at the further end  a winter and a summer
parlor  both fair   and under these rooms  a fair
and large cellar  sunk under ground  and likewise
some privy kitchens  with butteries and pantries 
and the like   as for the tower  i would have it two
stories  of eighteen foot high apiece  above the two
wings  and a goodly leads upon the top railed with
statuas interposed  and the same tower to be di 
vided into rooms  as shall be thought fit   the stairs
likewise to the upper rooms  let them be upon a
fair open newel  and finely railed in  with images
of wood  cast into a brass color  and a very fair
landing place at the top   but this to be  if you do
not point any of the lower rooms  for a dining place
of servants   for otherwise  you shall have the ser 
vants  dinner after your own  for the steam of it 
will come up as in a tunnel   and so much for the
front   only i understand the height of the first
stairs to be sixteen foot  which is the height of the
lower room 

beyond this front  is there to be a fair court  but
three sides of it  of a far lower building than the
front   and in all the four corners of that court  fair
staircases  cast into turrets  on the outside  and not
within the row of buildings themselves   but those
towers  are not to be of the height of the front  but
rather proportionable to the lower building   let
the court not be paved  for that striketh up a great
heat in summer  and much cold in winter   but
only some side alleys  with a cross  and the quar 
ters to graze  being kept shorn  but not too near
shorn   the row of return on the banquet side  let it
be all stately galleries  in which galleries let there
be three  or five  fine cupolas in the length of it 
placed at equal distance  and fine colored windows
of several works   on the household side  chambers
of presence and ordinary entertainments  with
some bed chambers  and let all three sides be a
double house  without thorough lights on the sides 
that you may have rooms from the sun  both for
forenoon and afternoon   cast it also  that you may
have rooms  both for summer and winter  shady
for summer  and warm for winter   you shall have
sometimes fair houses so full of glass  that one can 
not tell where to become  to be out of the sun or
cold   for inbowed windows  i hold them of good
use  in cities  indeed  upright do better  in respect
of the uniformity towards the street   for they be
pretty retiring places for conference  and besides 
they keep both the wind and sun off  for that
which would strike almost through the room  doth
scarce pass the window   but let them be but few 
four in the court  on the sides only 

beyond this court  let there be an inward court 
of the same square and height  which is to be en 
vironed with the garden on all sides  and in the
inside  cloistered on all sides  upon decent and
beautiful arches  as high as the first story   on the
under story  towards the garden  let it be turned
to a grotto  or a place of shade  or estivation   and
only have opening and windows towards the gar 
den  and be level upon the floor  no whit sunken
under ground  to avoid all dampishness   and let
there be a fountain  or some fair work of statuas  in
the midst of this court  and to be paved as the other
court was   these buildings to be for privy lodgings
on both sides  and the end for privy galleries 
whereof you must foresee that one of them be for
an infirmary  if the prince or any special person
should be sick  with chambers  bed chamber  ante 
camera  and recamera joining to it   this upon the
second story   upon the ground story  a fair gallery 
open  upon pillars  and upon the third story like 
wise  an open gallery  upon pillars  to take the
prospect and freshness of the garden   at both cor 
ners of the further side  by way of return  let there
be two delicate or rich cabinets  daintily paved 
richly hanged  glazed with crystalline glass  and
a rich cupola in the midst  and all other elegancy
that may be thought upon   in the upper gallery
too  i wish that there may be  if the place will yield
it  some fountains running in divers places from
the wall  with some fine avoidances   and thus
much for the model of the palace  save that you
must have  before you come to the front  three
courts   a green court plain  with a wall about it 
a second court of the same  but more garnished 
with little turrets  or rather embellishments  upon
the wall  and a third court  to make a square with
the front  but not to be built  nor yet enclosed with
a naked wall  but enclosed with terraces  leaded
aloft  and fairly garnished  on the three sides  and
cloistered on the inside  with pillars  and not with
arches below   as for offices  let them stand at dis 
tance  with some low galleries  to pass from them
to the palace itself 


of gardens


g0d almighty first planted a garden   and
indeed it is the purest of human pleasures 
it is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man 
without which  buildings and palaces are but
gross handiworks  and a man shall ever see  that
when ages grow to civility and elegancy  men
come to build stately sooner than to garden finely 
as if gardening were the greater perfection   i do
hold it  in the royal ordering of gardens  there
ought to be gardens  for all the months in the year 
in which severally things of beauty may be then
in season   for december  and january  and the
latter part of november  you must take such things
as are green all winter  holly  ivy  bays  juniper 
cypress trees  yew  pine apple trees  fir trees 
rosemary  lavender  periwinkle  the white  the
purple  and the blue  germander  flags  orange 
trees  lemon trees  and myrtles  if they be stoved 
and sweet marjoram  warm set   there followeth 
for the latter part of january and february  the
mezereon tree  which then blossoms  crocus ver 
nus  both the yellow and the grey  primroses 
anemones  the early tulippa  hyacinthus orien 
talis  chamairis  fritellaria   for march  there
come violets  specially the single blue  which are
the earliest  the yellow daffodil  the daisy  the
almond tree in blossom  the peach tree in blos 
som  the cornelian tree in blossom  sweet briar 
in april follow the double white violet  the wall 
flower  the stock gilliflower  the cowslip  flower 
delices  and lilies of all natures  rosemary flowers 
the tulippa  the double peony  the pale daffodil 
the french honeysuckle  the cherry tree in blos 
som  the damson and plum trees in blossom  the
white thorn in leaf  the lilac tree   in may and
june come pinks of all sorts  specially the blush 
pink  roses of all kinds  except the musk  which
comes later  honeysuckles  strawberries  bugloss 
columbine  the french marigold  flos africanus 
cherry tree in fruit  ribes  figs in fruit  rasps  vine 
flowers  lavender in flowers  the sweet satyrian 
with the white flower  herba muscaria  lilium
convallium  the apple tree in blossom   in july
come gilliflowers of all varieties  musk roses  the
lime tree in blossom  early pears and plums in
fruit  jennetings  codlins   in august come plums
of all sorts in fruit  pears  apricocks  berberries 
filberds  musk melons  monks hoods  of all colors 
in september come grapes  apples  poppies of
all colors  peaches  melocotones  nectarines  cor 
nelians  wardens  quinces   in october and the
beginning of november come services  medlars 
bullaces  roses cut or removed to come late  holly 
hocks  and such like   these particulars are for the
climate of london  but my meaning is perceived 
that you may have ver perpetuum  as the place
affords 

and because the breath of flowers is far sweeter
in the air  where it comes and goes like the warb 
ling of music  than in the hand  therefore nothing
is more fit for that delight  than to know what be
the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air 
roses  damask and red  are fast flowers of their
smells  so that you may walk by a whole row of
them  and find nothing of their sweetness  yea
though it be in a morning s dew   bays likewise
yield no smell as they grow   rosemary little  nor
sweet marjoram   that which above all others
yields the sweetest smell in the air is the violet 
specially the white double violet  which comes
twice a year  about the middle of april  and about
bartholomew tide   next to that is the musk rose 
then the strawberry leaves dying  which yield a
most excellent cordial smell   then the flower of
vines  it is a little dust  like the dust of a bent  which
grows upon the cluster in the first coming forth 
then sweet briar   then wall flowers  which are
very delightful to be set under a parlor or lower
chamber window   then pinks and gilliflowers 
especially the matted pink and clove gilliflower 
then the flowers of the lime tree   then the honey 
suckles  so they be somewhat afar off   of bean 
flowers i speak not  because they are field flowers 
but those which perfume the air most delightfully 
not passed by as the rest  but being trodden upon
and crushed  are three  that is  burnet  wild 
thyme  and watermints   therefore you are to set
whole alleys of them  to have the pleasure when
you walk or tread 

for gardens  speaking of those which are indeed
princelike  as we have done of buildings   the con 
tents ought not well to be under thirty acres of
ground  and to be divided into three parts  a green
in the entrance  a heath or desert in the going
forth  and the main garden in the midst  besides
alleys on both sides   and i like well that four acres
of ground be assigned to the green  six to the
heath  four and four to either side  and twelve to
the main garden   the green hath two pleasures 
the one  because nothing is more pleasant to the
eye than green grass kept finely shorn  the other 
because it will give you a fair alley in the midst  by
which you may go in front upon a stately hedge 
which is to enclose the garden   but because the
alley will be long  and  in great heat of the year or
day  you ought not to buy the shade in the garden 
by going in the sun through the green  therefore
you are  of either side the green  to plant a covert
alley upon carpenter s work  about twelve foot in
height  by which you may go in shade into the
garden   as for the making of knots or figures  with
divers colored earths   that they may lie under the
windows of the house on that side which the gar 
den stands  they be but toys  you may see as good
sights  many times  in tarts   the garden is best to
be square  encompassed on all the four sides with
a stately arched hedge   the arches to be upon pil 
lars of carpenter s work  of some ten foot high  and
six foot broad  and the spaces between of the same
dimension with the breadth of the arch   over the
arches let there be an entire hedge of some four
foot high  framed also upon carpenter s work  and
upon the upper hedge  over every arch  a little tur 
ret  with a belly  enough to receive a cage of birds 
and over every space between the arches some
other little figure  with broad plates of round col 
ored glass gilt  for the sun to play upon   but this
hedge i intend to be raised upon a bank  not steep 
but gently slope  of some six foot  set all with
flowers   also i understand  that this square of the
garden  should not be the whole breadth of the
ground  but to leave on either side  ground enough
for diversity of side alleys  unto which the two
covert alleys of the green  may deliver you   but
there must be no alleys with hedges  at either end
of this great enclosure  not at the hither end  for
letting your prospect upon this fair hedge from
the green  nor at the further end  for letting your
prospect from the hedge  through the arches upon
the heath 

for the ordering of the ground  within the great
hedge  i leave it to variety of device  advising
nevertheless  that whatsoever form you cast it into 
first  it be not too busy  or full of work   wherein i 
for my part  do not like images cut out in juniper
or other garden stuff  they be for children   little
low hedges  round  like welts  with some pretty
pyramids  i like well  and in some places  fair
columns upon frames of carpenter s work   i would
also have the alleys  spacious and fair   you may
have closer alleys  upon the side grounds  but none
in the main garden   i wish also  in the very middle 
a fair mount  with three ascents  and alleys 
enough for four to walk abreast  which i would
have to be perfect circles  without any bulwarks
or embossments  and the whole mount to be thirty
foot high  and some fine banqueting house  with
some chimneys neatly cast  and without too much
glass 

for fountains  they are a great beauty and re 
freshment  but pools mar all  and make the garden
unwholesome  and full of flies and frogs   foun 
tains i intend to be of two natures  the one that
sprinkleth or spouteth water  the other a fair re 
ceipt of water  of some thirty or forty foot square 
but without fish  or slime  or mud   for the first 
the ornaments of images gilt  or of marble  which
are in use  do well  but the main matter is so to
convey the water  as it never stay  either in the
bowls or in the cistern  that the water be never by
rest discolored  green or red or the like  or gather
any mossiness or putrefaction   besides that  it is to
be cleansed every day by the hand   also some
steps up to it  and some fine pavement about it 
doth well   as for the other kind of fountain  which
we may call a bathing pool  it may admit much
curiosity and beauty  wherewith we will not
trouble ourselves  as  that the bottom be finely
paved  and with images  the sides likewise  and
withal embellished with colored glass  and such
things of lustre  encompassed also with fine rails
of low statuas   but the main point is the same
which we mentioned in the former kind of foun 
tain  which is  that the water be in perpetual
motion  fed by a water higher than the pool  and
delivered into it by fair spouts  and then dis 
charged away under ground  by some equality of
bores  that it stay little   and for fine devices  of
arching water without spilling  and making it rise
in several forms  of feathers  drinking glasses 
canopies  and the like   they be pretty things to
look on  but nothing to health and sweetness 

for the heath  which was the third part of our
plot  i wish it to be framed  as much as may be  to
a natural wildness   trees i would have none in it 
but some thickets made only of sweet briar and
honeysuckle  and some wild vine amongst  and
the ground set with violets  strawberries  and
primroses   for these are sweet  and prosper in the
shade   and these to be in the heath  here and there 
not in any order   i like also little heaps  in the na 
ture of mole hills  such as are in wild heaths   to
be set  some with wild thyme  some with pinks 
some with germander  that gives a good flower to
the eye  some with periwinkle  some with violets 
some with strawberries  some  with cowslips  some
with daisies  some with red roses  some with lilium
convallium  some with sweet williams red  some
with bear s foot  and the like low flowers  being
withal sweet and sightly   part of which heaps  are
to be with standards of little bushes pricked upon
their top  and part without   the standards to be
roses  juniper  holly  berberries  but here and
there  because of the smell of their blossoms   red
currants  gooseberries  rosemary  bays  sweet 
briar  and such like   but these standards to be kept
with cutting  that they grow not out of course 

for the side grounds  you are to fill them with
variety of alleys  private  to give a full shade  some
of them  wheresoever the sun be   you are to frame
some of them  likewise  for shelter  that when the
wind blows sharp you may walk as in a gallery 
and those alleys must be likewise hedged at both
ends  to keep out the wind  and these closer alleys
must be ever finely gravelled  and no grass  be 
cause of going wet   in many of these alleys  like 
wise  you are to set fruit trees of all sorts  as well
upon the walls  as in ranges   and this would be
generally observed  that the borders wherein you
plant your fruit trees  be fair and large  and low 
and not steep  and set with fine flowers  but thin
and sparingly  lest they deceive the trees   at the
end of both the side grounds  i would have a mount
of some pretty height  leaving the wall of the en 
closure breast high  to look abroad into the fields 

for the main garden  i do not deny  but there
should be some fair alleys ranged on both sides 
with fruit trees  and some pretty tufts of fruit 
trees  and arbors with seats  set in some decent
order  but these to be by no means set too thick  but
to leave the main garden so as it be not close  but
the air open and free   for as for shade  i would
have you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds 
there to walk  if you be disposed  in the heat of the
year or day  but to make account  that the main
garden is for the more temperate parts of the year 
and in the heat of summer  for the morning and
the evening  or overcast days 

for aviaries  i like them not  except they be of
that largeness as they may be turfed  and have
living plants and bushes set in them  that the birds
may have more scope  and natural nesting  and
that no foulness appear in the floor of the aviary 
so i have made a platform of a princely garden 
partly by precept  partly by drawing  not a model 
but some general lines of it  and in this i have
spared for no cost   but it is nothing for great
princes  that for the most part taking advice with
workmen  with no less cost set their things to 
gether  and sometimes add statuas and such things
for state and magnificence  but nothing to the true
pleasure of a garden 




of negotiating



it is generally better to deal by speech than by
letter  and by the mediation of a third than by
a man s self   letters are good  when a man would
draw an answer by letter back again  or when it
may serve for a man s justification afterwards to
produce his own letter  or where it may be danger
to be interrupted  or heard by pieces   to deal in
person is good  when a man s face breedeth regard 
as commonly with inferiors  or in tender cases 
where a man s eye  upon the countenance of him
with whom he speaketh  may give him a direction
how far to go  and generally  where a man will
reserve to himself liberty  either to disavow or to
expound   in choice of instruments  it is better to
choose men of a plainer sort  that are like to do
that  that is committed to them  and to report back
again faithfully the success  than those that are
cunning  to contrive  out of other men s business 
somewhat to grace themselves  and will help the
matter in report for satisfaction s sake   use also
such persons as affect the business  wherein they
are employed  for that quickeneth much  and
such  as are fit for the matter  as bold men for ex 
postulation  fair spoken men for persuasion  crafty
men for inquiry and observation  froward  and
absurd men  for business that doth not well bear
out itself   use also such as have been lucky  and
prevailed before  in things wherein you have em 
ployed them  for that breeds confidence  and they
will strive to maintain their prescription   it is bet 
ter to sound a person  with whom one deals afar
off  than to fall upon the point at first  except you
mean to surprise him by some short question   it is
better dealing with men in appetite  than with
those that are where they would be   if a man deal
with another upon conditions  the start or first per 
formance is all  which a man cannot reasonably
demand  except either the nature of the thing be
such  which must go before  or else a man can
persuade the other party  that he shall still need
him in some other thing  or else that he be counted
the honester man   all practice is to discover  or to
work   men discover themselves in trust  in passion 
at unawares  and of necessity  when they would
have somewhat done  and cannot find an apt pre 
text   if you would work any man  you must either
know his nature and fashions  and so lead him  or
his ends  and so persuade him  or his weakness and
disadvantages  and so awe him  or those that have
interest in him  and so govern him   in dealing with
cunning persons we must ever consider their ends 
to interpret their speeches  and it is good to say
little to them  and that which they least look for 
in all negotiations of difficulty  a man may not
look to sow and reap at once  but must prepare
business  and so ripen it by degrees 





0f followers

and friends





costly followers are not to be liked  lest
while a man maketh his train longer  he
make his wings shorter   i reckon to be costly  not
them alone which charge the purse  but which are
wearisome  and importune in suits   ordinary fol 
lowers ought to challenge no higher conditions 
than countenance  recommendation  and protec 
tion from wrongs   factious followers are worse to
be liked  which follow not upon affection to him 
with whom they range themselves  but upon
discontentment conceived against some other 
whereupon commonly ensueth that ill intelli 
gence  that we many times see between great per 
sonages   likewise glorious followers  who make
themselves as trumpets of the commendation of
those they follow  are full of inconvenience  for
they taint business through want of secrecy  and
they export honor from a man  and make him a
return in envy   there is a kind of followers like 
wise  which are dangerous  being indeed espials 
which inquire the secrets of the house  and bear
tales of them  to others   yet such men  many times 
are in great favor  for they are officious  and com 
monly exchange tales   the following by certain
estates of men  answerable to that  which a great
person himself professeth  as of soldiers  to him
that hath been employed in the wars  and the like  
hath ever been a thing civil  and well taken  even
in monarchies  so it be without too much pomp
or popularity   but the most honorable kind of fol 
lowing  is to be followed as one  that apprehendeth
to advance virtue  and desert  in all sorts of per 
sons   and yet  where there is no eminent odds in
sufficiency  it is better to take with the more pass 
able  than with the more able   and besides  to
speak truth  in base times  active men are of more
use than virtuous   it is true that in government  it
is good to use men of one rank equally  for to coun 
tenance some extraordinarily  is to make them
insolent  and the rest discontent  because they
may claim a due   but contrariwise  in favor  to
use men with much difference and election is
good  for it maketh the persons preferred more
thankful  and the rest more officious  because all is
of favor   it is good discretion  not to make too much
of any man at the first  because one cannot hold
out that proportion   to be governed  as we call it 
by one is not safe  for it shows softness  and gives
a freedom  to scandal and disreputation  for those 
that would not censure or speak ill of a man imme 
diately  will talk more boldly of those that are so
great with them  and thereby wound their honor 
yet to be distracted with many is worse  for it
makes men to be of the last impression  and full of
change   to take advice of some few friends  is ever
honorable  for lookers on many times see more
than gamesters  and the vale best discovereth the
hill   there is little friendship in the world  and least
of all between equals  which was wont to be mag 
nified   that that is  is between superior and in 
ferior  whose fortunes may comprehend the one
the other 




of suitors



many ill matters and projects are under 
taken  and private suits do putrefy the pub 
lic good   many good matters  are undertaken with
bad minds  i mean not only corrupt minds  but
crafty minds  that intend not performance   some
embrace suits  which never mean to deal effectu 
ally in them  but if they see there may be life in
the matter  by some other mean  they will be con 
tent to win a thank  or take a second reward  or at
least to make use  in the meantime  of the suitor s
hopes   some take hold of suits  only for an occa 
sion to cross some other  or to make an informa 
tion  whereof they could not otherwise have apt
pretext  without care what become of the suit 
when that turn is served  or  generally  to make
other men s business a kind of entertainment  to
bring in their own   nay  some undertake suits 
with a full purpose to let them fall  to the end to
gratify the adverse party  or competitor   surely
there is in some sort a right in every suit  either a
right of equity  if it be a suit of controversy  or a
right of desert  if it be a suit of petition   if affection
lead a man to favor the wrong side in justice  let
him rather use his countenance to compound the
matter  than to carry it   if affection lead a man
to favor the less worthy in desert  let him do it 
without depraving or disabling the better deserver 
in suits which a man doth not well understand  it
is good to refer them to some friend of trust and
judgment  that may report  whether he may deal
in them with honor  but let him choose well his
referendaries  for else he may be led by the nose 
suitors are so distasted with delays and abuses 
that plain dealing  in denying to deal in suits at
first  and reporting the success barely  and in chal 
lenging no more thanks than one hath deserved 
is grown not only honorable  but also gracious   in
suits of favor  the first coming ought to take little
place  so far forth  consideration may be had of
his trust  that if intelligence of the matter could
not otherwise have been had  but by him  advan 
tage be not taken of the note  but the party left to
his other means  and in some sort recompensed 
for his discovery   to be ignorant of the value of a
suit  is simplicity  as well as to be ignorant of the
right thereof  is want of conscience   secrecy in
suits  is a great mean of obtaining  for voicing
them to be in forwardness  may discourage some
kind of suitors  but doth quicken and awake others 
but timing of the suit is the principal   timing  i
say  not only in respect of the person that should
grant it  but in respect of those  which are like to
cross it   let a man  in the choice of his mean  rather
choose the fittest mean  than the greatest mean 
and rather them that deal in certain things  than
those that are general   the reparation of a denial 
is sometimes equal to the first grant  if a man
show himself neither dejected nor discontented 
iniquum petas ut aequum feras is a good rule 
where a man hath strength of favor  but other 
wise  a man were better rise in his suit  for
he  that would have ventured at first to have lost
the suitor  will not in the conclusion lose both the
suitor  and his own former favor   nothing is
thought so easy a request to a great person  as his
letter  and yet  if it be not in a good cause  it is so
much out of his reputation   there are no worse
instruments  than these general contrivers of suits 
for they are but a kind of poison  and infection  to
public proceedings 




of studies



studies serve for delight  for ornament  and
for ability   their chief use for delight  is in
privateness and retiring  for ornament  is in dis 
course  and for ability  is in the judgment  and
disposition of business   for expert men can exe 
cute  and perhaps judge of particulars  one by one 
but the general counsels  and the plots and mar 
shalling of affairs  come best  from those that are
learned   to spend too much time in studies is sloth 
to use them too much for ornament  is affectation 
to make judgment wholly by their rules  is the
humor of a scholar   they perfect nature  and are
perfected by experience  for natural abilities are
like natural plants  that need proyning  by study 
and studies themselves  do give forth directions too
much at large  except they be bounded in by ex 
perience   crafty men contemn studies  simple men
admire them  and wise men use them  for they
teach not their own use  but that is a wisdom with 
out them  and above them  won by observation 
read not to contradict and confute  nor to believe
and take for granted  nor to find talk and dis 
course  but to weigh and consider   some books are
to be tasted  others to be swallowed  and some few
to be chewed and digested  that is  some books are
to be read only in parts  others to be read  but not
curiously  and some few to be read wholly  and
with diligence and attention   some books also may
be read by deputy  and extracts made of them by
others  but that would be only in the less impor 
tant arguments  and the meaner sort of books  else
distilled books are like common distilled waters 
flashy things   reading maketh a full man  confer 
ence a ready man  and writing an exact man   and
therefore  if a man write little  he had need have
a great memory  if he confer little  he had need
have a present wit  and if he read little  he had
need have much cunning  to seem to know  that
he doth not   histories make men wise  poets witty 
the mathematics subtile  natural philosophy deep 
moral grave  logic and rhetoric able to contend 
abeunt studia in mores   nay  there is no stond or
impediment in the wit  but may be wrought out
by fit studies  like as diseases of the body  may
have appropriate exercises   bowling is good for
the stone and reins  shooting for the lungs and
breast  gentle walking for the stomach  riding for
the head  and the like   so if a man s wit be wan 
dering  let him study the mathematics  for in
demonstrations  if his wit be called away never so
little  he must begin again   if his wit be not apt to
distinguish or find differences  let him study the
schoolmen  for they are cymini sectores   if he be
not apt to beat over matters  and to call up one
thing to prove and illustrate another  let him study 197
the lawyers  cases   so every defect of the mind 
may have a special receipt 






of faction

many have an opinion not wise  that for a
prince to govern his estate  or for a great
person to govern his proceedings  according to the
respect of factions  is a principal part of policy 
whereas contrariwise  the chiefest wisdom  is
either in ordering those things which are general 
and wherein men of several factions do neverthe 
less agree  or in dealing with correspondence to
particular persons  one by one   but i say not that
the considerations of factions  is to be neglected 
mean men  in their rising  must adhere  but
great men  that have strength in themselves  were
better to maintain themselves indifferent  and
neutral   yet even in beginners  to adhere so moder 
ately  as he be a man of the one faction  which is
most passable with the other  commonly giveth
best way   the lower and weaker faction  is the
firmer in conjunction  and it is often seen  that a
few that are stiff  do tire out a greater number  that
are more moderate   when one of the factions is ex 
tinguished  the remaining subdivideth  as the
faction between lucullus  and the rest of the
nobles of the senate  which they called optimates 
held out awhile  against the faction of pompey
and caesar  but when the senate s authority was
pulled down  caesar and pompey soon after brake 
the faction or party of antonius and octavianus
caesar  against brutus and cassius  held out like 
wise for a time  but when brutus and cassius were
overthrown  then soon after  antonius and octa 
vianus brake and subdivided   these examples are
of wars  but the same holdeth in private factions 
and therefore  those that are seconds in factions 
do many times  when the faction subdivideth 
prove principals  but many times also  they prove
ciphers and cashiered  for many a man s strength
is in opposition  and when that faileth  he groweth
out of use   it is commonly seen  that men  once
placed  take in with the  contrary faction  to that
by which they enter  thinking belike  that they
have the first sure  and now are ready for a new
purchase   the traitor in faction  lightly goeth
away with it  for when matters have stuck long in
balancing  the winning of some one man casteth
them  and he getteth all the thanks   the even car 
riage between two factions  proceedeth not always
of moderation  but of a trueness to a man s self 
with end to make use of both   certainly in italy 
they hold it a little suspect in popes  when they
have often in their mouth padre commune  and
take it to be a sign of one  that meaneth to refer all
to the greatness of his own house   kings had need
beware  how they side themselves  and make
themselves as of a faction or party  for leagues
within the state  are ever pernicious to monarchies 
for they raise an obligation  paramount to obliga 
tion of sovereignty  and make the king tanquam
unus ex nobis  as was to be seen in the league of
france   when factions are carried too high and too
violently  it is a sign of weakness in princes  and
much to the prejudice  both of their authority and
business   the motions of factions under kings
ought to be  like the motions  as the astronomers
speak  of the inferior orbs  which may have their
proper motions  but yet still are quietly carried  by
the higher motion of primum mobile 





of ceremonies 

and respects





he that is only real  had need have exceed 
ing great parts of virtue  as the stone had
need to be rich  that is set without foil   but if a
man mark it well   it is  in praise and commenda 
tion of men  as it is in gettings and gains  for the
proverb is true  that light gains make heavy
purses  for light gains come thick  whereas great 
come but now and then   so it is true  that small
matters win great commendation  because they
are continually in use and in note  whereas the
occasion of any great virtue  cometh but on festi 
vals   therefore it doth much add to a man s reputa 
tion  and is  as queen isabella said  like perpetual
letters commendatory  to have good forms   to at 
tain them  it almost sufficeth not to despise them 
for so shall a man observe them in others  and let
him trust himself with the rest   for if he labor too
much to express them  he shall lose their grace 
which is to be natural and unaffected   some men s
behavior is like a verse  wherein every syllable is
measured  how can a man comprehend great mat 
ters  that breaketh his mind too much  to small
observations  not to use ceremonies at all  is to
teach others not to use them again  and so dimin 
isheth respect to himself  especially they be not to
be omitted  to strangers and formal natures  but
the dwelling upon them  and exalting them above
the moon  is not only tedious  but doth diminish
the faith and credit of him that speaks   and cer 
tainly  there is a kind of conveying  of effectual
and imprinting passages amongst compliments 
which is of singular use  if a man can hit upon it 
amongst a man s peers  a man shall be sure of
familiarity  and therefore it is good  a little to keep
state   amongst a man s inferiors one shall be sure
of reverence  and therefore it is good  a little to be
familiar   he that is too much in anything  so that
he giveth another occasion of satiety  maketh him 
self cheap   to apply one s self to others  is good  so
it be with demonstration  that a man doth it upon
regard  and not upon facility   it is a good precept
generally  in seconding another  yet to add some 
what of one s own  as if you will grant his opinion 
let it be with some distinction  if you will follow
his motion  let it be with condition  if you allow
his counsel  let it be with alleging further reason 
men had need beware  how they be too perfect in
compliments  for be they never so sufficient other 
wise  their enviers will be sure to give them that
attribute  to the disadvantage of their greater vir 
tues   it is loss also in business  to be too full of re 
spects  or to be curious  in observing times and
opportunities   solomon saith  he that considereth
the wind  shall not sow  and he that looketh to
the clouds  shall not reap   a wise man will make
more opportunities  than he finds   men s behavior
should be  like their apparel  not too strait or point
device  but free for exercise or motion 






of praise


praise is the reflection of virtue  but it is as
the glass or body  which giveth the reflec 
tion   if it be from the common people  it is com 
monly false and naught  and rather followeth vain
persons  than virtuous   for the common people
understand not many excellent virtues   the lowest
virtues draw praise from them  the middle virtues
work in them astonishment or admiration  but of
the highest virtues  they have no sense of perceiv 
ing at all   but shows  and species virtutibus similes 
serve best with them   certainly fame is like a river 
that beareth up things light and swoln  and drowns
things weighty and solid   but if persons of quality
and judgment concur  then it is  as the scripture
saith  nomen bonum instar unguenti fragrantis 
it fireth all round about  and will not easily away 
for the odors of ointments are more durable  than
those of flowers   there be so many false points of
praise  that a man may justly hold it a suspect 
some praises proceed merely of flattery  and if he
be an ordinary flatterer  he will have certain com 
mon attributes  which may serve every man  if he
be a cunning flatterer  he will follow the arch 
flatterer  which is a man s self  and wherein a man
thinketh best of himself  therein the flatterer will
uphold him most  but if he be an impudent flat 
terer  look wherein a man is conscious to himself 
that he is most defective  and is most out of counte 
nance in himself  that will the flatterer entitle him
to perforce  spreta conscientia   some praises come
of good wishes and respects  which is a form due  in
civility  to kings and great persons  laudando
praecipere  when by telling men what they are 
they represent to them  what they should be   some
men are praised maliciously  to their hurt  thereby
to stir envy and jealousy towards them  pessimum
genus inimicorum laudantium  insomuch as it
was a proverb  amongst the grecians  that he that
was praised to his hurt  should have a push rise
upon his nose  as we say  that a blister will rise
upon one s tongue  that tells a lie   certainly mod 
erate praise  used with opportunity  and not vul 
gar  is that which doth the good   solomon saith 
he that praiseth his friend aloud  rising early  it
shall be to him no better than a curse   too much
magnifying of man or matter  doth irritate con 
tradiction  and procure envy and scorn   to praise
a man s self  cannot be decent  except it be in rare
cases  but to praise a man s office or profession  he
may do it with good grace  and with a kind of mag 
nanimity   the cardinals of rome  which are theo 
logues  and friars  and schoolmen  have a phrase
of notable contempt and scorn towards civil busi 
ness  for they call all temporal business of wars 
embassages  judicature  and other employments 
sbirrerie  which is under sheriffries  as if they
were but matters  for under sheriffs and catch 
poles  though many times those under sheriffries
do more good  than their high speculations   st 
paul  when he boasts of himself  he doth oft inter 
lace  i speak like a fool  but speaking of his calling 
he saith  magnificabo apostolatum meum 




of vain glory



it was prettily devised of aesop  the fly sat
upon the axle tree of the chariot wheel  and
said  what a dust do i raise  so are there some vain
persons  that whatsoever goeth alone  or moveth
upon greater means  if they have never so little
hand in it  they think it is they that carry it   they
that are glorious  must needs be factious  for all
bravery stands upon comparisons   they must
needs be violent  to make good their own vaunts 
neither can they be secret  and therefore not ef 
fectual  but according to the french proverb 
beaucoup de bruit  peu de fruit  much bruit little
fruit   yet certainly  there is use of this quality in
civil affairs   where there is an opinion and fame to
be created  either of virtue or greatness  these men
are good trumpeters   again  as titus livius noteth 
in the case of antiochus and the aetolians  there
are sometimes great effects  of cross lies  as if a
man  that negotiates between two princes  to draw
them to join in a war against the third  doth extol
the forces of either of them  above measure  the
one to the other  and sometimes he that deals be 
tween man and man  raiseth his own credit with
both  by pretending greater interest than he hath
in either   and in these and the like kinds  it often
falls out  that somewhat is produced of nothing 
for lies are sufficient to breed opinion  and opinion
brings on substance   in militar commanders and
soldiers  vain glory is an essential point  for as
iron sharpens iron  so by glory  one courage sharp 
eneth another   in cases of great enterprise upon
charge and adventure  a composition of glorious
natures  doth put life into business  and those that
are of solid and sober natures  have more of the
ballast  than of the sail   in fame of learning  the
flight will be slow without some feathers of osten 
tation   qui de contemnenda gloria libros scri 
bunt  nomen  suum inscribunt   socrates  aristotle 
galen  were men full of ostentation   certainly
vain glory helpeth to perpetuate a man s memory 
and virtue was never so beholding to human na 
ture  as it received his due at the second hand 
neither had the fame of cicero  seneca  plinius
secundus  borne her age so well  if it had not been
joined with some vanity in themselves  like unto
varnish  that makes ceilings not only shine but
last   but all this while  when i speak of vain glory 
i mean not of that property  that tacitus doth at 
tribute to mucianus  omnium quae dixerat fece 
ratque arte quadam ostentator  for that proceeds
not of vanity  but of natural magnanimity and
discretion  and in some persons  is not only comely 
but gracious   for excusations  cessions  modesty
itself well governed  are but arts of ostentation 
and amongst those arts  there is none better than
that which plinius secundus speaketh of  which is
to be liberal of praise and commendation to others 
in that  wherein a man s self hath any perfection 
for saith pliny  very wittily  in commending
another  you do yourself right  for he that you
commend  is either superior to you in that you
commend  or inferior   if he be inferior  if he be to
be commended  you much more  if he be superior 
if he be not to be commended  you much less 
glorious men are the scorn of wise men  the ad 
miration of fools  the idols of parasites  and the
slaves of their own vaunts 






of honor
and reputation



the winning of honor  is but the revealing of
a man s virtue and worth  without disadvan 
tage   for some in their actions  do woo and effect
honor and reputation  which sort of men  are
commonly much talked of  but inwardly little
admired   and some  contrariwise  darken their
virtue in the show of it  so as they be undervalued
in opinion   if a man perform that  which hath not
been attempted before  or attempted and given
over  or hath been achieved  but not with so good
circumstance  he shall purchase more honor  than
by effecting a matter of greater difficulty or virtue 
wherein he is but a follower   if a man so temper
his actions  as in some one of them he doth content
every faction  or combination of people  the music
will be the fuller   a man is an ill husband of bis
honor  that entereth into any action  the failing
wherein may disgrace him  more than the carry 
ing of it through  can honor him   honor that is
gained and broken upon another  hath the quick 
est reflection  like diamonds cut with facets   and
therefore  let a man contend to excel any competi 
tors of his in honor  in outshooting them  if he can 
in their own bow   discreet followers and servants 
help much to reputation   omnis fama a domesticis
emanat   envy  which is the canker of honor  is
best extinguished by declaring a man s self in
his ends  rather to seek merit than fame  and by
attributing a man s successes  rather to divine
providence and felicity  than to his own virtue or
policy 

the true marshalling of the degrees of sovereign
honor  are these  in the first place are conditores
imperiorum  founders of states and common 
wealths  such as were romulus  cyrus  caesar 
ottoman  ismael   in the second place are legis 
latores  lawgivers  which are also called second
founders  or perpetui principes  because they gov 
ern by their ordinances after they are gone  such
were lycurgus  solon  justinian  eadgar  alphon 
sus of castile  the wise  that made the siete parti 
das   in the third place are liberatores  or salvatores 
such as compound the long miseries of civil
wars  or deliver their countries from servitude of
strangers or tyrants  as augustus caesar  vespasi 
anus  aurelianus  theodoricus  king henry the
seventh of england  king henry the fourth of
france   in the fourth place are propagatores or
propugnatores imperii  such as in honorable wars
enlarge their territories  or make noble defence
against invaders   and in the last place are patres
patriae  which reign justly  and make the times
good wherein they live   both which last kinds need
no examples  they are in such number   degrees of
honor  in subjects  are  first participes curarum 
those upon whom  princes do discharge the great 
est weight of their affairs  their right hands  as
we call them   the next are duces belli  great leaders
in war  such as are princes  lieutenants  and do
them notable services in the wars   the third are
gratiosi  favorites  such as exceed not this scant 
ling  to be solace to the sovereign  and harmless to
the people   and the fourth  negotiis pares  such as
have great places under princes  and execute their
places  with sufficiency   there is an honor  like 
wise  which may be ranked amongst the greatest 
which happeneth rarely  that is  of such as sacri 
fice themselves to death or danger for the good of
their country  as was m  regulus  and the two
decii 



of judicature


judges ought to remember  that their office is
jus dicere  and not jus dare  to interpret law 
and not to make law  or give law   else will it be
like the authority  claimed by the church of rome 
which under pretext of exposition of scripture 
doth not stick to add and alter  and to pronounce
that which they do not find  and by show of an 
tiquity  to introduce novelty   judges ought to be
more learned  than witty  more reverend  than
plausible and more advised  than confident   above
all things  integrity is their portion and proper
virtue   cursed  saith the law  is he that removeth
the landmark   the mislayer of a mere stone is to
blame   but it is the unjust judge  that is the capital
remover of landmarks  when he defineth amiss  of
lands and property   one foul sentence doth more
hurt  than many foul examples   for these do but
corrupt the stream  the other corrupteth the foun 
tain   so with solomon  fons turbatus  et vena
corrupta  est justus cadens in causa sua coram
adversario   the office of judges may have reference
unto the parties that use  unto the advocates that
plead  unto the clerks and ministers of justice
underneath them  and to the sovereign or state
above them 

first  for the causes or parties that sue   there be
 saith the scripture  that turn judgment  into
wormwood  and surely there be also  that turn it
into vinegar  for injustice maketh it bitter  and
delays make it sour   the principal duty of a judge 
is to suppress force and fraud  whereof force is the
more pernicious  when it is open  and fraud  when
it is close and disguised   add thereto contentious
suits  which ought to be spewed out  as the surfeit
of courts   a judge ought to prepare his way to a
just sentence  as god useth to prepare his way  by
raising valleys and taking down hills  so when
there appeareth on either side an high hand  vio 
lent prosecution  cunning advantages taken  com 
bination  power  great counsel  then is the virtue
of a judge seen  to make inequality equal  that he
may plant his judgment as upon an even ground 
qui fortiter emungit  elicit sanguinem  and where
the wine press is hard wrought  it yields a harsh
wine  that tastes of the grape stone   judges must
beware of hard constructions  and strained infer 
ences  for there is no worse torture  than the tor 
ture of laws   specially in case of laws penal  they
ought to have care  that that which was meant for
terror  be not turned into rigor  and that they
bring not upon the people  that shower whereof
the scripture speaketh  pluet super eos laqueos 
for penal laws pressed  are a shower of snares upon
the people   therefore let penal laws  if they have
been sleepers of long  or if they be grown unfit for
the present time  be by wise judges confined in the
execution  judicis officium est  ut res  ita tempora
rerum  etc   in causes of life and death  judges ought
 as far as the law permitteth  in justice to remem 
ber mercy  and to cast a severe eye upon the
example  but a merciful eye upon the person 

secondly  for the advocates and counsel that
plead   patience and gravity of hearing  is an essen 
tial part of justice  and an overspeaking judge is no
well tuned cymbal   it is no grace to a judge  first
to find that  which he might have heard in due
time from the bar  or to show quickness of conceit 
in cutting off evidence or counsel too short  or to
prevent information by questions  though perti 
nent   the parts of a judge in hearing  are four  to
direct the evidence  to moderate length  repetition 
or impertinency of speech  to recapitulate  select 
and collate the material points  of that which hath
been said  and to give the rule or sentence   what 
soever is above these is too much  and proceedeth
either of glory  and willingness to speak  or of im 
patience to hear  or of shortness of memory  or of
want of a staid and equal attention   it is a strange
thing to see  that the boldness of advocates should
prevail with judges  whereas they should imitate
god  in whose seat they sit  who represseth the pre 
sumptuous  and giveth grace to the modest   but it
is more strange  that judges should have noted
favorites  which cannot but cause multiplication
of fees  and suspicion of by ways   there is due from
the judge to the advocate  some commendation
and gracing  where causes are well handled and
fair pleaded  especially towards the side which
obtaineth not  for that upholds in the client  the
reputation of his counsel  and beats down in him
the conceit of his cause   there is likewise due to the
public  a civil reprehension of advocates  where
there appeareth cunning counsel  gross neglect 
slight information  indiscreet pressing  or an over 
bold defence   and let not the counsel at the bar 
chop with the judge  nor wind himself into the
handling of the cause anew  after the judge hath
declared his sentence  but  on the other side  let
not the judge meet the cause half way  nor give
occasion to the party  to say his counsel or proofs
were not heard 

thirdly  for that that concerns clerks and minis 
ters   the place of justice is an hallowed place  and
therefore not only the bench  but the foot place 
and precincts and purprise thereof  ought to be
preserved without scandal and corruption   for
certainly grapes  as the scripture saith  will not
be gathered of thorns or thistles  either can justice
yield her fruit with sweetness  amongst the briars
and brambles of catching and polling clerks  and
ministers   the attendance of courts  is subject to
four bad instruments   first  certain persons that
are sowers of suits  which make the court swell 
and the country pine   the second sort is of those 
that engage courts in quarrels of jurisdiction  and
are not truly amici curiae  but parasiti curiae  in
puffing a court up beyond her bounds  for their
own scraps and advantage   the third sort  is of
those that may be accounted the left hands of
courts  persons that are full of nimble and sinister
tricks and shifts  whereby they pervert the plain
and direct courses of courts  and bring justice into
oblique lines and labyrinths   and the fourth  is the
poller and exacter of fees  which justifies the com 
mon resemblance of the courts of justice  to the
bush whereunto  while the sheep flies for defence
in weather  he is sure to lose part of his fleece   on
the other side  an ancient clerk  skilful in prece 
dents  wary in proceeding  and understanding in
the business of the court  is an excellent finger of
a court  and doth many times point the way to the
judge himself 

fourthly  for that which may concern the sov 
ereign and estate   judges ought above all to re 
member the conclusion of the roman twelve
tables  salus populi suprema lex  and to know
that laws  except they be in order to that end  are
but things captious  and oracles not well inspired 
therefore it is an happy thing in a state  when
kings and states do often consult with judges  and
again  when judges do often consult with the king
and state  the one  when there is matter of law 
intervenient in business of state  the other  when
there is some consideration of state  intervenient
in matter of law   for many times the things de 
duced to judgment may be meum and tuum  when
the reason and consequence thereof may trench to
point of estate  i call matter of estate  not only the
parts of sovereignty  but whatsoever introduceth
any great alteration  or dangerous precedent  or
concerneth manifestly any great portion of peo 
ple   and let no man weakly conceive  that just
laws and true policy have any antipathy  for they
are like the spirits and sinews  that one moves with
the other   let judges also remember  that solo 
mon s throne was supported by lions on both sides 
let them be lions  but yet lions under the throne 
being circumspect that they do not check or oppose
any points of sovereignty   let not judges also be
ignorant of their own right  as to think there is not
left to them  as a principal part of their office  a
wise use and application of laws   for they may
remember  what the apostle saith of a greater law
than theirs  nos scimus quia lex bona est  modo
quis ea utatur legitime 





of anger


to seek to extinguish anger utterly  is but a
bravery of the stoics   we have better oracles 
be angry  but sin not   let not the sun go down
upon your anger   anger must be limited and con 
fined  both in race and in time   we will first speak
how the natural inclination and habit to be angry 
may be attempted and calmed   secondly  how the
particular motions of anger may be repressed  or
at least refrained from doing mischief   thirdly 
how to raise anger  or appease anger in another 

for the first  there is no other way but to medi 
tate  and ruminate well upon the effects of anger 
how it troubles man s life   and the best time to do
this  is to look back upon anger  when the fit is
thoroughly over   seneca saith well  that anger is
like ruin  which breaks itself upon that it falls 
the scripture exhorteth us to possess our souls in
patience   whosoever is out of patience  is out of
possession of his soul   men must not turn bees 


     animasque in vulnere ponunt 



anger is certainly a kind of baseness  as it ap 
pears well in the weakness of those subjects in
whom it reigns  children  women  old folks  sick
folks   only men must beware  that they carry
their anger rather with scorn  than with fear  so
that they may seem rather to be above the injury 
than below it  which is a thing easily done  if a
man will give law to himself in it 

for the second point  the causes and motives of
anger  are chiefly three   first  to be too sensible of
hurt  for no man is angry  that feels not himself
hurt  and therefore tender and delicate persons
must needs be oft angry  they have so many things
to trouble them  which more robust natures have
little sense of   the next is  the apprehension and
construction of the injury offered  to be  in the cir 
cumstances thereof  full of contempt  for contempt
is that  which putteth an edge upon anger  as much
or more than the hurt itself   and therefore  when
men are ingenious in picking out circumstances of
contempt  they do kindle their anger much   lastly 
opinion of the touch of a man s reputation  doth
multiply and sharpen anger   wherein the remedy
is  that a man should have  as consalvo was wont
to say  telam honoris crassiorem   but in all refrain 
ings of anger  it is the best remedy to win time 
and to make a man s self believe  that the oppor 
tunity of his revenge is not yet come  but that he
foresees a time for it  and so to still himself in the
meantime  and reserve it 

to contain anger from mischief  though it take
hold of a man  there be two things  whereof you
must have special caution   the one  of extreme bit 
terness of words  especially if they be aculeate and
proper  for cummunia maledicta are nothing so
much  and again  that in anger a man reveal no
secrets  for that  makes him not fit for society   the
other  that you do not peremptorily break off  in
any business  in a fit of anger  but howsoever you
show bitterness  do not act anything  that is not
revocable 

for raising and appeasing anger in another  it
is done chiefly by choosing of times  when men
are frowardest and worst disposed  to incense
them   again  by gathering  as was touched before 
all that you can find out  to aggravate the con 
tempt   and the two remedies are by the contraries 
the former to take good times  when first to relate
to a man an angry business  for the first impres 
sion is much  and the other is  to sever  as much as
may be  the construction of the injury from the
point of contempt  imputing it to misunderstand 
ing  fear  passion  or what you will 




of vicissitude
of things



solomon saith  there is no new thing upon
the earth   so that as plato had an imagination 
that all knowledge was but remembrance  so
solomon giveth his sentence  that all novelty is
but oblivion   whereby you may see  that the river
of lethe runneth as well above ground as below 
there is an abstruse astrologer that saith  if it were
not for two things that are constant  the one is 
that the fixed stars ever stand a like distance one
from another  and never come nearer together  nor
go further asunder  the other  that the diurnal
motion perpetually keepeth time   no individual
would last one moment   certain it is  that the mat 
ter is in a perpetual flux  and never at a stay   the
great winding sheets  that bury all things in ob 
livion  are two  deluges and earthquakes   as for
conflagrations and great droughts  they do not
merely dispeople and destroy   phaeton s car went
but a day   and the three years  drought in the time
of elias  was but particular  and left people alive 
as for the great burnings by lightnings  which are
often in the west indies  they are but narrow   but
in the other two destructions  by deluge and earth 
quake  it is further to be noted  that the remnant
of people which hap to be reserved  are commonly
ignorant and mountainous people  that can give
no account of the time past  so that the oblivion is
all one  as if none had been left   if you consider
well of the people of the west indies  it is very
probable that they are a newer or a younger peo 
ple  than the people of the old world   and it is
much more likely  that the destruction that hath
heretofore been there  was not by earthquakes  as
the egyptian priest told solon concerning the
island of atlantis  that it was swallowed by an
earthquake   but rather that it was desolated by a
particular deluge   for earthquakes are seldom in
those parts   but on the other side  they have such
pouring rivers  as the rivers of asia and africk and
europe  are but brooks to them   their andes  like 
wise  or mountains  are far higher than those with
us  whereby it seems  that the remnants of gen 
eration of men  were in such a particular deluge
saved   as for the observation that machiavel hath 
that the jealousy of sects  doth much extinguish
the memory of things  traducing gregory the
great  that he did what in him lay  to extinguish
all heathen antiquities  i do not find that those
zeals do any great effects  nor last long  as it ap 
peared in the succession of sabinian  who did
revive the former antiquities 

the vicissitude of mutations in the superior
globe  are no fit matter for this present argument 
it may be  plato s great year  if the world should
last so long  would have some effect  not in renew 
ing the state of like individuals  for that is the fume
of those  that conceive the celestial bodies have
more accurate influences upon these things below 
than indeed they have   but in gross   comets  out
of question  have likewise power and effect  over
the gross and mass of things  but they are rather
gazed upon  and waited upon in their journey 
than wisely observed in their effects  specially in 
their respective effects  that is  what kind of comet 
for magnitude  color  version of the beams  plac 
ing in the reign of heaven  or lasting  produceth
what kind of effects 

there is a toy which i have heard  and i would
not have it given over  but waited upon a little 
they say it is observed in the low countries  i
know not in what part  that every five and thirty
years  the same kind and suit of years and weath 
ers come about again  as great frosts  great wet 
great droughts  warm winters  summers with little
heat  and the like  and they call it the prime   it is
a thing i do the rather mention  because  comput 
ing backwards  i have found some concurrence 

but to leave these points of nature  and to come
to men   the greatest vicissitude of things amongst
men  is the vicissitude of sects and religions   for
those orbs rule in men s minds most   the true re 
ligion is built upon the rock  the rest are tossed 
upon the waves of time   to speak  therefore  of the
causes of new sects  and to give some counsel con 
cerning them  as far as the weakness of human
judgment can give stay  to so great revolutions 
when the religion formerly received  is rent by
discords  and when the holiness of the professors
of religion  is decayed and full of scandal  and
withal the times be stupid  ignorant  and bar 
barous  you may doubt the springing up of a new
sect  if then also  there should arise any extrava 
gant and strange spirit  to make himself author
thereof   all which points held  when mahomet
published his law   if a new sect have not two prop 
erties  fear it not  for it will not spread   the one is
the supplanting  or the opposing  of authority es 
tablished  for nothing is more popular than that 
the other is the giving license to pleasures  and a
voluptuous life   for as for speculative heresies
 such as were in ancient times the arians  and now
the armenians   though they work mightily upon
men s wits  yet they do not produce any great al 
terations in states  except it be by the help of civil
occasions   there be three manner of plantations of
new sects   by the power of signs and miracles  by
the eloquence  and wisdom  of speech and persua 
sion  and by the sword   for martyrdoms  i reckon
them amongst miracles  because they seem to ex 
ceed the strength of human nature  and i may do
the like  of superlative and admirable holiness of
life   surely there is no better way  to stop the rising
of new sects and schisms  than to reform abuses  to
compound the smaller differences  to proceed
mildly  and not with sanguinary persecutions 
and rather to take off the principal authors by win 
ning and advancing them  than to enrage them
by violence and bitterness 

the changes and vicissitude in wars are many 
but chiefly in three things  in the seats or stages of
the war  in the weapons  and in the manner of the
conduct   wars  in ancient time  seemed more to
move from east to west  for the persians  assyrians 
arabians  tartars  which were the invaders  were
all eastern people   it is true  the gauls were west 
ern  but we read but of two incursions of theirs 
the one to gallo grecia  the other to rome   but east
and west have no certain points of heaven  and no
more have the wars  either from the east or west 
any certainty of observation   but north and south
are fixed  and it hath seldom or never been seen
that the far southern people have invaded the
northern  but contrariwise   whereby it is manifest
that the northern tract of the world  is in nature
the more martial region  be it in respect of the stars
of that hemisphere  or of the great continents that
are upon the north  whereas the south part  for
aught that is known  is almost all sea  or  which is
most apparent  of the cold of the northern parts 
which is that which  without aid of discipline 
doth make the bodies hardest  and the courages
warmest 

upon the breaking and shivering of a great state
and empire  you may be sure to have wars   for
great empires  while they stand  do enervate and
destroy the forces of the natives which they have
subdued  resting upon their own protecting forces 
and then when they fail also  all goes to ruin  and
they become a prey   so was it in the decay of the
roman empire  and likewise in the empire of
almaigne  after charles the great  every bird tak 
ing a feather  and were not unlike to befall to
spain  if it should break   the great accessions and
unions of kingdoms  do likewise stir up wars  for
when a state grows to an over power  it is like a
great flood  that will be sure to overflow   as it hath
been seen in the states of rome  turkey  spain 
and others   look when the world hath fewest bar 
barous peoples  but such as commonly will not
marry or generate  except they know means to live
 as it is almost everywhere at this day  except tar 
tary   there is no danger of inundations of people 
but when there be great shoals of people  which go
on to populate  without foreseeing means of life
and sustentation  it is of necessity that once in an
age or two  they discharge a portion of their people
upon other nations  which the ancient northern
people were wont to do by lot  casting lots what
part should stay at home  and what should seek
their fortunes   when a warlike state grows soft and
effeminate  they may be sure of a war   for com 
monly such states are grownm rich in the time of
their degenerating  and so the prey inviteth  and
their decay in valor  encourageth a war 

as for the weapons  it hardly falleth under rule
and observation  yet we see even they  have re 
turns and vicissitudes   for certain it is  that ord 
nance was known in the city of the oxidrakes in
india  and was that  which the macedonians
called thunder and lightning  and magic   and it
is well known that the use of ordnance  hath been
in china above two thousand years   the conditions
of weapons  and their improvement  are  first  the
fetching afar off  for that outruns the danger  as
it is seen in ordnance and muskets   secondly  the
strength of the percussion  wherein likewise ord 
nance do exceed all arietations and ancient inven 
tions   the third is  the commodious use of them  as
that they may serve in all weathers  that the car 
riage may be light and manageable  and the like 

for the conduct of the war  at the first  men
rested extremely upon number  they did put the
wars likewise upon main force and valor  pointing
days for pitched fields  and so trying it out upon
an even match and they were more ignorant in
ranging and arraying their battles   after  they
grew to rest upon number rather competent  than
vast  they grew to advantages of place  cunning
diversions  and the like  and they grew more skil 
ful in the ordering of their battles 

in the youth of a state  arms do flourish  in the
middle age of a state  learning  and then both of
them together for a time  in the declining age of a
state  mechanical arts and merchandize   learning
hath his infancy  when it is but beginning and
almost childish  then his youth  when it is luxuri 
ant and juvenile  then his strength of years  when
it is solid and reduced  and lastly  his old age  when
it waxeth dry and exhaust   but it is not good to look
too long upon these turning wheels of vicissitude 
lest we become giddy   as for the philology of
them  that is but a circle of tales  and therefore not
fit for this writing 





of fame


the poets make fame a monster   they de 
scribe her in part finely and elegantly  and
in part gravely and sententiously   they say  look
how many feathers she hath  so many eyes she
hath underneath  so many tongues  so many
voices  she pricks up so many ears 

this is a flourish   there follow excellent par 
ables  as that  she gathereth strength in going 
that she goeth upon the ground  and yet hideth her
head in the clouds  that in the daytime she sitteth
in a watch tower  and flieth most by night  that
she mingleth things done  with things not done 
and that she is a terror to great cities   but that
which passeth all the rest is  they do recount that
the earth  mother of the giants that made war
against jupiter  and were by him destroyed  there 
upon in an anger brought forth fame   for certain
it is  that rebels  figured by the giants  and seditious
fames and libels  are but brothers and sisters  mas 
culine and feminine   but now  if a man can tame
this monster  and bring her to feed at the hand 
and govern her  and with her fly other ravening
fowl and kill them  it is somewhat worth   but we
are infected with the style of the poets   to speak
now in a sad and serious manner  there is not  in
all the politics  a place less handled and more
worthy to be handled  than this of fame   we will
therefore speak of these points  what are false
fames  and what are true fames  and how they
may be best discerned  how fames may be sown 
and raised  how they may be spread  and multi 
plied  and how they may be checked  and laid
dead   and other things concerning the nature of
fame   fame is of that force  as there is scarcely any
great action  wherein it hath not a great part  es 
pecially in the war   mucianus undid vitellius  by
a fame that he scattered  that vitellius had in pur 
pose to remove the legions of syria into germany 
and the legions of germany into syria  where 
upon the legions of syria were infinitely inflamed 
julius caesar took pompey unprovided  and laid
asleep his industry and preparations  by a fame
that he cunningly gave out  caesar s own soldiers
loved him not  and being wearied with the wars 
and laden with the spoils of gaul  would forsake
him  as soon as he came into italy   livia settled
all things for the succession of her son tiberius  by
continual giving out  that her husband augustus
was upon recovery and amendment  and it is an
usual thing with the pashas  to conceal the death
of the great turk from the janizaries and men of
war  to save the sacking of constantinople and
other towns  as their manner is   themistocles made
xerxes  king of persia  post apace out of grecia  by
giving out  that the grecians had a purpose to
break his bridge of ships  which he had made ath 
wart hellespont   there be a thousand such like
examples  and the more they are  the less they
need to be repeated  because a man meeteth with
them everywhere   therefore let all wise governors
have as great a watch and care over fames  as they
have of the actions and designs themselves
